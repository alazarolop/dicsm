Such measurement techniques tend to be tedious and time-consuming and the designated landform elements cannot be easily overlaid on any digital map and imagery for further applied research. This study deals with a new quantitative geomorphometric procedure, based on the multivariate statistical analysis of local topographic gradients within a part of northcentral Crete. This method employs sets of computer algorithms that automatically extract and classify geomorphometric properties from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). This was done by evaluating the morphological setting around each pixel of the DEM along the eight azimuth directions. ISODATA unsupervised classification was implemented to generate 10 morphometric classes showing the spatial distribution of areas with a similar geomorphic scenario.},

  abstract = {Soil mapping in Denmark has a long history and a series of soil maps based on conventional mapping approaches have been produced. In this study, a national soil map of Denmark was constructed based on the FAO–Unesco Revised Legend 1990 using digital soil mapping techniques, existing soil profile observations and environmental data. This map was developed using soil-landscape models generated with a decision tree-based digital soil mapping technique. As input variables in the model, more than 1170 soil profile data and 17 environmental variables including geology, land use, landscape type, area of wetlands, digital elevation model and its derivatives were compiled. The predicted map showed that Podzols and Luvisols were the most frequent soil groups, covering almost two-thirds of the area of Denmark. Geographically, Podzols occupied a major portion of western Denmark, where the soils have developed on sandy parent material, whereas eastern Denmark mostly contained Luvisols developed on loamy basal till. The occurrence of the predicted soil groups was assigned using several variables, of the most important was clay content in the topsoil and subsoil, elevation, geology and landscape type. The overall prediction accuracy based on a 20\% hold-back validation data was 60\%, but increased to 76\% when prediction accuracy of similar soil groups was considered. Podzoluvisols and Alisols were among the weakly predicted groups (b 48\% prediction confidence), whereas Podzols and Luvisols had the highest accuracy of prediction (N 70\%). Overall, the average prediction uncertainty was less than 34\%. Compared to the existing conventional soil map, the new map showed promising predictions. Validation of the predicted map with different techniques (point validation, prediction confidence analysis, and map-to-map comparison) confirmed that the output is reliable and can be used in various soil and environmental studies without major difficulties. This study also verified the importance of GlobalSoilMap products and a priori pedological information that improved prediction performance and quality of the new FAO soil map of Denmark.},

  abstract = {A digital mapping approach was applied to soils in Scotland, producing maps at 100-m­ resolution and different levels of classification. This used neural networks to predict fuzzy soil class weightings based upon site descriptors from existing soil survey data. The intention of this work was to produce a set of soil maps for Scotland, which provide greater spatial resolution mapping than currently available, and provide fuzzy data to be used in mapping of ecosystem services using a novel approach explained in a second paper. When selecting the class with the highest weighting for test data points, Producer's Accuracy of 70.7\% was achieved in mapping the broadest classification (five classes), while Producer's Accuracy levels of 59.9\% and 43.7\% were achieved for 11 and 30 classes, respectively. Evaluation of confusion matrices generated from the neural network model tests showed that, particularly for the classification systems with 11 and 30 classes, misclassification errors were more common between similar soil classes than between classes that were very different from one another. This implies that straightforward estimation of classification accuracy that measures “correct” and “incorrect” gives misleading results, and that the fuzzy classification maps are more useful than the crisp classification accuracy values. These fuzzy classification maps are therefore potentially useful for evaluating ecosystem services relating to soil type. We conclude that the mapping approach used here provides a classification accuracy comparable to other approaches and that the outputs can be used for mapping soil properties, processes, functions and ecosystem services.},

Dimension reduction is often undertaken to help in interpreting the data set but, as each principal component usually involves all the original variables, interpretation of a PCA can still be difficult. One way to overcome this difficulty is to select a subset of the original variables and use this subset to approximate the principal components. This article reviews a number of techniques for choosing subsets of the variables and examines their merits in terms of preserving the information in the PCA, and in aiding interpretation of the main sources of variation in the data.

  abstract = {Semi-automated geomorphological mapping techniques are gradually replacing classical techniques due to increasing availability of high-quality digital topographic data. In order to efficiently analyze such large amounts of data, there is a need for optimizing the processing of automated mapping techniques. In this context, we present a novel approach to semi-automatically map alpine geomorphology using stratified object-based image analysis. We used a 1 m Digital Terrain Model (DTM) derived from laser altimetry data from a mountainous catchment from which we calculated various Land-Surface Parameters (LSPs). The LSPs ‘slope angle’ and ‘topographic openness’ have been combined into a single composite layer for selecting reference material and delineating training samples. We developed a novel method to semi-automatically assess segmentation results by comparing 2D frequency distribution matrices of training samples and image objects. The segmentation accuracy assessment allowed us to automate optimization of the scale parameter and LSPs used for segmentation. We concluded that different geomorphological feature types have different sets of optimal segmentation parameters. The feature-dependent parameters were used in a new approach of stratified feature extraction for classifying karst, glacial, fluvial and denudational landforms. In this way, we have used stratified object-based image analysis to semi-automatically extract contrasting geomorphological features from high-resolution digital terrain data. A further step would be to also automate the optimization of classification rules. We would then be able to create a library of feature characteristics that could be transferred and applied to other mountain regions and further automate geomorphological mapping strategies.},

  abstract = {In a previous study we introduced structural equation modelling (SEM) for digital soil mapping in the Argentine Pampas. An attractive property of SEM is that it incorporates pedological knowledge explicitly through a mathematical implementation of a conceptual model. Many soil processes operate within the soil profile; therefore, SEM might be suitable for simultaneous prediction of soil properties for multiple soil layers. In this way, relations between soil properties in different horizons can be included that might result in more consistent predictions. The objectives of this study were therefore to apply SEM to multi-layer and multivariate soil mapping, and to test SEM functionality for suggestions to improve the modelling. We applied SEM to model and predict the lateral and vertical distribution of the cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) and clay content of three major soil horizons, A, B and C, for a 23 000-km2 region in the Argentine Pampas. We developed a conceptual model based on pedological hypotheses. Next, we derived a mathematical model and calibrated it with environmental covariates and soil data from 320 soil profiles. Cross-validation of predicted soil properties showed that SEM explained only marginally more of the variance than a linear regression model. However, assessment of the covariation showed that SEM reproduces the covariance between variables much more accurately than linear regression. We concluded that SEM can be used to predict several soil properties in multiple layers by considering the interrelations between soil properties and layers.},

  abstract = {In theory, two separate regions with the same soil-forming factors should develop similar soil conditions. This theoretical finding has been used in digital soil mapping (DSM) to extrapolate a model from one area to another, which usually does not work out well. One reason for failure could be that most of these studies used empirical methods. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is a semi-mechanistic technique, which can explicitly include expert knowledge. We therefore hypothesize that SEM models are more suitable for extrapolation than purely empirical models in DSM. The objective of this study was to investigate the extrapolation capability of SEM by comparing different model settings. We applied a SEM model from a previous study in Argentina to a similar soillandscape in the Great Plains of the United States to predict clay, organic carbon, and cation exchange capacity for three major horizons: A, B, and C. We concluded that system relationships that were well supported by pedological knowledge showed consistent and equal behaviour in both study areas. In addition, a deeper understanding of indicators of soil-forming factors could strengthen conceptual models for extrapolating DSM models. We also found that for model extrapolation, knowledge-based links between system variables are more effective than data-driven links. In particular, model modifications can improve local prediction but harm the predictive power of extrapolation.},

  abstract = {Empirical models for seven climatic variables (monthly mean air temperature, monthly mean daily minimum and maximum air temperature, monthly mean relative humidity, monthly precipitation, monthly mean global solar irradiation and monthly potential evapotranspiration) were built using neural networks. Climatic data from 127 weather stations were used, comprising more than 30000 cases for each variable. Independent estimators were elevation, latitude, longitude, month and time series of respective climatic variable observed at two weather stations (coastal and inland), which have long time-series of climatic variables (from mid last century). Goodness of fit by model was very high for all climatic variables (R\textbackslash{} 0.98), except for monthly mean relative humidity and monthly precipitation, for which it was somewhat lower (R=0.84 and R = 0.80, respectively). Differences in residuals around model were insignificant between months, but significant between weather stations, both for all climatic variables. This was the reason for calculation of mean residuals for all stations, which were spatially interpolated by kriging and used as a model correction. Similarly interpolated standard deviation and standard error of residuals are estimators of the model precision and model error, respectively. Goodness of fit after the averaging of monthly values between years was very high for all climatic variables, which enables construction of spatial distributions of average climate (climatic atlas) for a given period. Presented interpolation models provide reliable, both spatial and temporal estimations of climatic variables, especially useful for dendroecological analysis. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The generation of gridded climate data sets in the form of interpolated surfaces may help to fill climate datagaps and in turns enable climate change impact assessments. This article generates climate surfaces of monthly total precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures for Nigeria at 0.001∘ spatial resolution by comparing two spatial interpolation techniques, i.e. kriging with external drifts and thin plate splines. Climate data from 43 meteorological stations covering the period of 1960–2012 were used to generate climate surfaces fitting the longitude, latitude, elevation and distance to coastline of the stations as independent variables. Three model error statistics, i.e. root mean square error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and index of agreement (d), were used to evaluate and compare the performances of interpolation techniques. The second-order and third-order partial thin plate splines were identified as the optimal models for generating precipitation, and minimum and maximum temperatures surfaces, respectively. The best-fit surfaces yielded an average RMSE, NSE and d of 14.98, 0.87 and 0.97 for precipitation, 0.42, 0.91 and 0.98 for minimum temperature and 0.52, 0.89 and 0.97 for maximum temperature. Our high-resolution climate surfaces are freely available from an online repository and widely applicable for climate change analysis as well as for biological, forestry and agricultural studies in Nigeria.},

  abstract = {The increasing global coverage of high resolution/large-scale digital elevation data has allowed the study of geomorphological form to receive renewed attention by providing accessible datasets for the characterisation and quantification of land surfaces. Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide quantitative elevation data, but it is the characterisation and extraction of geomorphologically significant measures (morphometric indices) from these raw data that form more informative and useful datasets. Common to many geographical measures, morphometric measures derived from DEMs are dependent on the scale of observation. This paper reports results of employing a fuzzy c-means classification for a sample DEM from Snowdonia, Wales, with a number of morphometric measures at different resolutions as input, and morphometric classification of landforms at each resolution as output. The classifications reveal that different landscape components or morphometric classes are important at different resolutions, and that morphometric classes exhibit resolution dependency in their geographical extents. Examination of the scale dependency and behaviour of morphometric classifications of landforms at different resolutions provides a fuller and more holistic view of the classes present than a single-scale analysis.},

  abstract = {In this concluding paper, we summarize the main advances coming forward from the joint conference of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) Working Groups (WG) “Digital Soil mapping” (DSM) and “GlobalSoilMap”. We outline the increased availability of data and covariates. Large efforts to rescue legacy data and to put them in a harmonized format are ongoing in many parts of the world. New countries are joining the GlobalSoilMap initiative. During the same time, significant progress have been made in the countries which were among the first to develop GlobalSoilMap products. We stress the recent trends in tools used for predictive mapping of soil properties. Some solutions were proposed to solve issues about data privacy. We give examples on how to move from DSM soil digital soil mapping assessment. Aligning our research with ongoing activities within the Global Soil Partnership of the FAO has been proven successful. A need was expressed to work on the uncertainty of indicators of prediction performances and to re-evaluate validation strategies. It is necessary to develop more intuitive metrics for uncertainty assessment for interpreting and evaluating soil maps. The main progresses, remaining issues and challenges and the way forward are summarized and we propose ambitious working plans and road-maps for the two WGs and stress their complementarities.},

  abstract = {Since the turn of the millennium, digital soil mapping (DSM) has revolutionized the production of fine resolution gridded soil data with associated uncertainty. However, the link to conventional soil maps has not been sufficiently explained nor are the approaches complementary and synergistic. Further training on the digital soil mapping approaches, and associated strengths and weaknesses is required. The user community requires training in, and experience with, the new digital soil map products, especially about the use of uncertainties for risk modelling and policy development. Standards are required for public and private sector digital soil map products to prevent the production of poor-quality information which will become misleading and counter-productive. Machine-learning methods are to be used with caution with respect to their interpretability and parsimony. The use of DSM products for improved pedological understanding and soil survey interpretations requires urgent investigation.},

In this study, we compared six machine learning algorithms to predict and map soil classes in Zeb El Gherbi, Biskra Province. A total of 331 soil point observations classified according to the World Reference Base and optimal covariates were used as input data in the models. The final map was validated from data of 135 soil points. Our results showed that random forest was the most accurate algorithm. Elevation, multi-scale elevation and grain size index covariates had the most significant influence on the prediction of soil classes. The accuracy of the random forest model increased in the reference soil groups, with principal qualifiers composed of 13 classes compared to the reference soil groups with 5 classes. Haplic Petric Gypsisols, Gleyic Solonchaks and Haplic Gypsisols were the most common soils, constituting 67.46\% of the total area mapped. The methodological approach developed could be used to accelerate and improve soil mapping in other Saharan areas of Algeria.},

  abstract = {With the advent of the new generation of microwave and optical sensors with unique characteristics, the multi-sensor fusion for the soil moisture retrieval has given rise to a considerable research interest. The Sentinel satellites enable operational soil moisture mapping with moderate accuracy while providing regular temporal coverage and high spatial resolution at no cost to the users. In the meantime, working at the object level enables us to take advantage of some of the unique capabilities of this approach. This letter outlines an object-based approach for the multi-scale soil moisture retrieval by coupling the single polarization C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data. To fulfil this goal, a broad range of optical and texture features was extracted from the optical and single polarization mode SAR data. Subsequently, the relevant features were properly selected using the Random Forest-Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE) algorithm. Then, the selected features were imported to the segmentation process to create the image objects. Afterwards, the support vector regression (SVR) technique was used to estimate the soil moisture value of the image objects and to conduct the multiscale soil moisture retrieval with a small training database. It is observed that the proposed approach can provide multi-scale soil moisture maps with a reasonable accuracy in different applications requiring different scale requirements.},

  abstract = {Detailed soil surveys involve costly and time-consuming work and require expert knowledge. Since soil surveys provide information to meet a wide range of needs, new methods are necessary to map soils quickly and accurately. In this study, multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed to map soil units using digital elevation model (DEM) attributes. Several optimal ANNs were produced based on a number of input data and hidden units. The approach used test and validation areas to calculate the accuracy of interpolated and extrapolated data. The results showed that the system and level of soil classification employed had a direct effect on the accuracy of the results. At the lowest level, smaller errors were observed with the World Reference Base (WRB) classification criteria than the Soil Taxonomy (ST) system, but more soil classes could be predicted when using ST (7 soils in the case of ST vs. 5 with WRB). Training errors were below 11\% for all the ANN models applied, while the test error (interpolation error) and validation error (extrapolation error) were as high as 50\% and 70\%, respectively. As expected, soil prediction using a higher level of classification presented a better overall level of accuracy. To obtain better predictions, in addition to DEM attributes, data related to landforms and/or lithology as soil-forming factors, should be used as ANN input data.},

Laboratory, field and airborne spectrometer (ROSIS) data are acquired, in combination with soil samples, which are analysed for dithionite extractable iron (Fed) content. Analysis of the properties of two iron related absorption features present in laboratory spectra demonstrates good relations, especially between the standard deviation (S.D.) of the values in an absorption feature and the Fed content (R2 = 0.67) as well as the ratio based Redness Index (R2 = 0.51). Such derived relations are less strong for the ROSIS data (R2 for S.D. = 0.26 and R2 for Redness Index = 0.22). The spatial distribution of iron in vegetated areas shows a strong sensitivity of these relations with the presence of vegetation. A combination of both methods shows that the overestimation of the Fed content with the one method is (partly) compensated by the underestimation with the other method.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an innovative geographic information systems (GIS)-based model that can assist soil scientists in soil survey by providing quantitative data on soils and landscape characteristics. Using GIS data exploration techniques, nine data layers (percent slope, slope length, profile curvature, tangential curvature, mean curvature, flow accumulation, flow line density, distance to troughs, and distance to summits) were extracted from U.S. Geological Survey 30-m (98.43 ft) digital elevation models. A GIS clustering algorithm identified 50 landscape signatures from the nine data layers. A maximum likelihood discriminate analysis classifier was employed using the nine data layers and the 50 landscape signatures to create landscape classification information. This model provides an objective understanding of the soil-landscape relationship. The model was tested at a case study site in a quarter section of Massac County, Illinois, an area of homogeneous loess. Preliminary analysis indicates that the statistical relevance of the model is high, as a regression equation obtained a coefficient of determination (R2) of .88. Thus the potential predictive capabilities of the model are great, and should be extended to heterogeneous landscapes through further testing. This GIS landscape model could be used by soil scientists to advance their knowledge of the soil-landscape relationship, and ultimately enhance soil survey in the future.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) provides quality-assessed and standardised soil profile data to support digital soil mapping and environmental applications at broad scale levels. Since the release of the first {$<$}q{$>$}WoSIS snapshot{$<$}/q{$>$}, in July 2016, many new soil data were shared with us, registered in the ISRIC data repository, and subsequently standardised in accordance with the licences specified by the data providers. Soil profile data managed in WoSIS were contributed by a wide range of data providers, therefore special attention was paid to measures for soil data quality and the standardisation of soil property definitions, soil property values (and units of measurement), and soil analytical method descriptions. We presently consider the following soil chemical properties (organic carbon, total carbon, total carbonate equivalent, total Nitrogen, Phosphorus (extractable-P, total-P, and P-retention), soil pH, cation exchange capacity, and electrical conductivity) and physical properties (soil texture (sand, silt, and clay), bulk density, coarse fragments, and water retention), grouped according to analytical procedures (aggregates) that are operationally comparable. Further, for each profile, we provide the original soil classification (FAO, WRB, USDA, and version) and horizon designations insofar as these have been specified in the source databases. Measures for geographical accuracy (i.e. location) of the point data as well as a first approximation for the uncertainty associated with the operationally defined analytical methods are presented, for possible consideration in digital soil mapping and subsequent earth system modelling. The latest (\emph{dynamic}) set of quality-assessed and standardised data, called {$<$}q{$>$}wosis\_latest{$<$}/q{$>$}, is freely accessible via an OGC-compliant WFS (web feature service). For consistent referencing, we also provide time-specific \emph{static} {$<$}q{$>$}snapshots{$<$}/q{$>$}. The present snapshot (September 2019) comprises 196,498 geo-referenced profiles originating from 173 countries. They represent over 832 thousand soil layers (or horizons), and over 5.8 million records. The actual number of observations for each property varies (greatly) between profiles and with depth, this generally depending on the objectives of the initial soil sampling programmes. In the coming years, we aim to fill gradually gaps in the geographic and feature space, this subject to the sharing of a wider selection of soil profile data for so far under-represented areas and properties by our existing and prospective partners.

Here, we describe the first spatial analysis of the data from these surveys using geostatistics. Four years of data (1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001) were chosen to examine the available phosphorus (P). At each farm, four fields were sampled, but for the earlier years, coordinates were available for the farm only and not for each field. The average data for each farm were suitable for analysis and the variograms showed spatial structure even with a small sample size. Temporal change was evident in the kriged maps and also in the results of a Student’s t-test. The decline in values over time, particularly in the east of England, is associated with a reduction in the use of fertilizer P.},

In this paper, we provide a discussion of the various approaches to the modeling of spatial variates, and we propose a modeling framework that is able to incorporate the most important effects usually found in spatial variates, including fixed and random spatial effects, spatial trends, and heteroscedasticity. We provide a case study of the analysis of eight soil properties in a mountain catchment in the Spanish Pyrenees.As explanatory covariates, we use several topography parameters, which can be related to the pedogenetic processes active in the area. Several of them proved useful for explaining the variability of soil properties, explaining up to 77\% of their variance.We focus on the importance of model selection in order to determine which effects are relevant for modeling each soil parameter.We find that the full model is not necessarily optimal for all the variables tested and that the model should be adapted to the complexity of each individual case.This paper is a contribution to the discussion on the modeling of spatial variates and to the eventual development of a general theory of spatial variates.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) involves the use of georeferenced information and statistical models to map predictions and uncertainties related to soil properties. Many remote regions of the globe, such as boreal forest ecosystems, are characterized by low sampling efforts and limited availability of field soil data. Although DSM is an expanding topic in soil science, little guidance currently exists to select the appropriate combination of statistical methods and model formulation in the context of limited data availability. Using the Canadian managed forest as a case study, the main objective of this study was to investigate to which extent the choice of statistical method and model specification could improve the spatial prediction of soil properties with limited data. More specifically, we compared the cross-product performance of eight statistical approaches (linear, additive and geostatistical models, and four machine-learning techniques) and three model formulations (“covariates only”: a suite of environmental covariates only; “spatial only”: a function of geographic coordinates only; and “covariates + spatial”: a combination of both covariates and spatial functions) to predict five key forest soil properties in the organic layer (thickness and C:N ratio) and in the top 15 cm of the mineral horizon (carbon concentration, percentage of sand, and bulk density). Our results show that 1) although strong differences in predictive performance occurred across all statistical approaches and model formulations, spatially explicit models consistently had higher R2 and lower RMSE values than non-spatial models for all soil properties, except for the C:N ratio; 2) Bayesian geostatistical models were among the best methods, followed by ordinary kriging and machine-learning methods; and 3) comparative analyses made it possible to identify the more performant models and statistical methods to predict specific soil properties. We make modeling tools and code available (e.g., Bayesian geostastical models) that increase DSM capabilities and support existing efforts toward the production of improved digital soil products with limited data.},

Thus, this study focuses on the development of a methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANN) that is able to spatially predict soil units. Within a test area in Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), covering an area of about 600 km2, a digital soil map was predicted. Based on feed-forward ANN with the resilient backpropagation learning algorithm, the optimal network topology was determined with one hidden layer and 15 to 30 cells depending on the soil unit to be predicted. To describe the occurrence of a soil unit and to train the ANN, 69 different terrain attributes, 53 geologic-petrographic units, and 3 types of land use were extracted from existing maps and databases. 80\% of the predicted soil units (n = 33) showed training errors (mean square error) of the ANN below 0.1, 43\% were even below 0.05. Validation returned a mean accuracy of over 92\% for the trained network outputs. Altogether, the presented methodology based on ANN and an extended digital terrainanalysis approach is time-saving and cost effective and provides remarkable results.},

  abstract = {We present a new digital terrain analysis framework for digital soil mapping, referred to as contextual elevation mapping (ConMap). In contrast to common regression approaches based on features from digital terrain analysis, ConMap is not based on standard terrain attributes, but on elevation differences from the centre pixel to each pixel in circular neighbourhoods only. These differences are used as features in random forest regressions. We applied and validated the framework by predicting topsoil silt content in a loess region of 1150 km2 in Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse, Germany. Three hundred and forty-two samples and a 20-m resolution digital elevation model were used for this illustration and validation. We compared ConMap with standard and multi-scale terrain analysis approaches as well as with ordinary kriging interpolations. Crossvalidation root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 16.1 when the standard digital terrain analysis was used to 11.2 when ConMap was used. This corresponds to an increase in variance explained (R2) from 15 to 61\%. Even though ordinary kriging out-performed standard terrain analysis as well, the variance explained was 6\% smaller compared with that using ConMap. The results show that the geomorphic settings in the study area must have induced the spatial trend, which can be accounted for by ConMap over different scales. We conclude that ConMap shows great potential for digital soil mapping studies.},

  abstract = {Terrain attributes are the most widely used predictors in digital soil mapping. Nevertheless, discussion of techniques for addressing scale issues and feature selection has been limited. Therefore, we provide a framework for incorporating multi-scale concepts into digital soil mapping and for evaluating these scale effects. Furthermore, soil formation and soil-forming factors vary and respond at different scales. The spatial data mining approach presented here helps to identify both the scale which is important for mapping soil classes and the predictive power of different terrain attributes at different scales. The multi-scale digital terrain analysis approach is based on multiple local average filters with filter sizes ranging from 3 × 3 up to 31 × 31 pixels. We used a 20-m DEM and a 1:50 000 soil map for this study. The feature space is extended to include the terrain conditions measured at different scales, which results in highly correlated features (terrain attributes). Techniques to condense the feature space are therefore used in order to extract the relevant soil forming features and scales. The prediction results, which are based on a robust classification tree (CRUISE) show that the spatial pattern of particular soil classes varies at characteristic scales in response to particular terrain attributes. It is shown that some soil classes are more prevalent at one scale than at other scales and more related to some terrain attributes than to others. Furthermore, the most computationally efficient ANOVA-based feature selection approach is competitive in terms of prediction accuracy and the interpretation of the condensed datasets. Finally, we conclude that multi-scale as well as feature selection approaches deserve more research so that digital soil mapping techniques are applied in a proper spatial context and better prediction accuracy can be achieved.},

"The multi-scale digital terrain analysis approach is based on multiple local averagefilters withfilter sizes ranging from 3×3 up to 31×31 pixels. We used a 20-m DEM and a 1:50 000 soil map for this study. The feature space is extended to include the terrain conditions measured at different scales, which results in highly correlated features (terrain attributes). Techniques to condense the feature space are therefore used in order to extract the relevant soil forming features and scales." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=1}{Behrens et al 2010:175})
\par
"Furthermore, the most computationally efficient ANOVA-based feature selection approach is competitive in terms of prediction accuracy and the interpretation of the condensed datasets" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=1}{Behrens et al 2010:175})
\par
"Finally, we conclude that multi-scale as well as feature selection approaches deserve more research so that digital soil mapping techniques are applied in a proper spatial context and better prediction accuracy can be achieved." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=1}{Behrens et al 2010:175})
\par
"Terrain attributes are the most widely used predictors in digital soil mapping (McBratney et al., 2003). This is because relief is one of the most important soil-forming factors (Jenny, 1941) and digital elevation models (DEM) are widely available at different resolutions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=1}{Behrens et al 2010:175})
\par
"Terrain attributes are the most widely used predictors in digital soil mapping. Nevertheless, discussion of techniques for addressing scale issues and feature selection has been limited. Therefore, we provide a framework for incorporating multi-scale concepts into digital soil mapping and for evaluating these scale effects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=1}{Behrens et al 2010:175})
\par
"The spatial data mining approach presented here helps to identify both the scale which is important for mapping soil classes and the predictive power of different terrain attributes at different scales." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=1}{Behrens et al 2010:175})
\par
"Methods for incorporating analyses of different scales of variation into techniques for mapping the distribution of soil classes have not been widely reported in the literature (Hupy et al., 2004)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=1}{Behrens et al 2010:175})

\par
"The core of this approach is to compute terrain variables over a range offilter sizes, which not only increases the feature space, that is, the number of variables used as predictors, but also produces a set of highly correlated features (terrain attributes). Dimension reduction and feature selection techniques (cf. Liu and Motoda, 1998) are then used to reduce the feature space and select proper features in order to extract the relevant soil-forming features and scales for each soil class in a map."

\par
"Relative profile curvature is the ratio of two mean slope values: the mean slope of all cells higher than the centre cell divided by the mean slope of all cells lower than the centre cell (Behrens, 2003). Thus, it is a measure of local mass balance." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=3}{Behrens et al 2010:177})
\par
"Relative horizontal curvature (RHC) Relative horizontal curvature is based on an analysis of the aspect of the neighbouring pixels around a centre cell (Kleefisch and Köthe, 1993). If the aspect of a neighbouring grid cell is directly pointing into the centre cell, a value of 100 is assigned to the corresponding cell, whereas−100 is assigned if it points to the opposite direction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=3}{Behrens et al 2010:177})
\par
"The approach to calculate topographic roughness is based on the variation of slope and aspect within a local neighbourhood (Behrens, 2003)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=4}{Behrens et al 2010:178})
\par
"The variety (number of different values) is calculated within a 7×7 pixel neighbourhood for both slope and aspect" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=4}{Behrens et al 2010:178})

\par
"Wood (1996) argues that the scale implied by the resolution of DEM is not always appropriate in the context of landscape characterization. We assume that this holds true for digital soil mapping, as has been shown in other works (Behrens, 2003; Behrens et al., 2005, 2008; Smith et al., 2006; Zhu, 2008)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=4}{Behrens et al 2010:178})
\par
"We applied square local neighbourhood averagingfilters with sizes of n×n pixels, where n is an odd number ranging from 3 to 31, to all terrain attributes to investigate the influence of scale in digital soil mapping systematically" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=4}{Behrens et al 2010:178})
\par
"One alternative method is to calculate terrain attributes based on DEMs with different resolutions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=4}{Behrens et al 2010:178})
\par
"Another alternative approach is tofit multi-scale quadratic approximations to elevation values within windows of varying dimensions (e.g. Haralick, 1983; Wood, 1996; Smith et al. 2006). Compared to these two alternatives, the main technical advantage of the approach of local average filtering used in the present study is that it can easily be applied to any terrain attribute, regardless of the underlying algorithm." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=4}{Behrens et al 2010:178})
\par
"and second, regarding data mining techniques, a reasonable selection of features mitigates the "curse of dimensionality". The curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Bellmann (1961), points to the problem of highly dimensional data, yielding weaker prediction results compared to datasets with a reduced feature space (Pechenizkiy et al., 2003)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=5}{Behrens et al 2010:179})
\par
"The importance of a feature, or the predictive power of a feature, can be calculated in two waysbased on so-calledfilter or wrapper approaches (John et al.,1994)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=5}{Behrens et al 2010:179})
\par
"Afilter approach is carried out as a preprocessing step of a prediction. It identifies the relevant features that have a significant impact on the corresponding spatial distribution of soil classes (Lai et al., 2006). In contrast tofilter approaches, the importance of features in wrapper approaches is calculated as the result of multiple runs of a prediction algorithm based on changes in the features training dataset. The most effective subset is then generally used in thefinal predictions (Breiman, 1996)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=5}{Behrens et al 2010:179})
\par
"Hence, supervised feature selection is based on the feature importance, whereas the unsupervised case is better described with statistical dimension reduction." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=5}{Behrens et al 2010:179})
\par

"In order to analyze each terrain attribute independently, we implemented a decision stump (Iba and Langley,1992) based on an ANOVA F-ratio. For feature selection each terrain attribute is tested against each soil class. T" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=5}{Behrens et al 2010:179})
\par
"We applied a stochastic optimization approach using random subsets of the total number of features because a full-featured search was not possible given the 608 features we had to work with" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=5}{Behrens et al 2010:179})
\par
"This method is part of various ensemble prediction approaches" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=5}{Behrens et al 2010:179})

"Different approaches are possible to select an optimal performing subset asthefinal setof predictors. Themoststraightforward approachis to selectthebestperforming subset (KohaviandJohn,1997),whichisthe classical wrapper approach. Another approach is to average prediction accuraciesoverthefeaturesandto selectthebest performing featuresfor thefinal prediction."

"the random subspace models can reveal non-linear relationships and possible interactions between features (Zhao and Liu, 2007) when decision trees, artificial neural networks or similar methods are used" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=5}{Behrens et al 2010:179})
\par
"All feature selection approaches used in this study return ordered lists of features. Hence, criteria need to be applied to select a reduced subset" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"In the case of PCA we used the Kaiser criterion or Eigenvaluerule (Kaiser, 1960)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"Therefore, we picked all terrain attributes with the highest Eigenvalue for each component as final features for the prediction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"Hence, the evaluation of PCA cannot directly be compared with other studies using PCA as a feature extraction technique." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})

"For the ANOVA approach we analyzed all soil classes with the aim offinding a threshold, where each soil class could be described by at least two terrain features." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"In the random subset approach, the number of features chosen in the random subset method determines the size of the subset." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"Consequently, we compared the three possible random subset approaches of feature ordering based on thefirst 25 top ranked features." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"For predictions we used a 10-fold cross-validated 1D CRUISE classification tree approach (Kim and Loh, 2001)," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})

"which, among artificial neural networks, was shown to be one of the best data mining base" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})

"CRUISE is based on an ANOVA approach for selecting the best feature to split a branch of a tree and on a linear discriminant analysis for split point selection." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"We decided to use the CRUISE classification tree in this study to have a consistent methodological framework for the linear and nonlinear supervised feature selection as well as for the prediction approach, as both methods are based on an analysis of variance." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"To validate the results in the spatial domain we used the F1-measure (van Rijsbergen,1979) to compare the predictions for training as well as for independent validation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"The F1-measure is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall based on the confusion matrix (Table 3):" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=6}{Behrens et al 2010:180})
\par
"As found in other studies (Pechenizkiy et al., 2003), the unsupervised PCA approach turned out to be the worst technique in terms of selecting optimal features for all six soil classes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"The semisupervised class-PCA approach performed slightly better (Tables 5 and 6)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"As shown in Table 4, both PCA approaches select more local terrain attributes than regional ones (cf. Section 2.2) compared to the supervised approaches" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"This is evident especially for the aspect attributes (D0, D45, D90, and D135) and indicates that PCA has a serious drawback, as it gives high weights to features with a high variability, irrespective of whether they are useful for classification or not. As a result, the chosen features might have poor discriminating power (Pechenizkiy et al., 2003)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"The ANOVA approaches are recommended for evaluating feature importance as they require the least processing time and also respect Occam's razor by identifying the fewest number of predictor variables. The selection of attributes and the prediction achieved using ANOVA are faster than a prediction approach using all attributes and much faster than using RSS." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"In summary, it can be stated that only about 1\% of the 608 terrain datasets was needed to achieve the most effective predictions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"Furthermore, all supervised approaches worked much better than the alternative unsupervised and semi-supervised PCA approaches." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"Thus, non-linearity and feature interaction appear to not be pronounced in this dataset." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})

"where the selected features and the corresponding relevant scales are listed. It is remarkable that only 7\% of the parameters chosen are unfiltered (ANOVA1, RSS4)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"some degree the mean spatial ranges correlate with the spatial shapes of the soil classes. This is shown by the corresponding area / perimeter ratios in Fig. 3." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"For example, soil classes with an elongated shape, such as S1, correspond to smallfilter sizes, whereas larger units with a more "areal" character, such as S6, respond to largerfilter sizes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"However, even if the mean spatial ranges can be interpreted, it is important tofilter each terrain attribute with differentfilter sizes as each attribute has its highest predictive power at differentfilter sizes (Table 4) for different soil classes and for different prediction methods." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=8}{Behrens et al 2010:182})
\par
"This is one of the most important results. It shows that evenwithin one soil class differentfilter sizes are needed for different terrain attributes to achieve optimized predictions. Thus, it is important to test all filtered attributes on all soil classes of a map separately." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=9}{Behrens et al 2010:183})
\par
"This clearly demonstrates the importance of multi-scale digital terrain analysis in predicting soil classes. For each soil class different scales and different attributes are identified as most important." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=9}{Behrens et al 2010:183})

\par
"This emphasizes the existence of the influence of scale. Furthermore, this also indicates that the influence of scale does not exist in a random fashion. Instead, it is related to soil-forming processes and the general geomorphometry at the landscape scale." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=9}{Behrens et al 2010:183})
\par
"The PCA approaches for feature selection returned comparatively weak prediction accuracies for four soil classes. Only for soil classes S2 and S4 PCA shows reasonable results. T" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=10}{Behrens et al 2010:184})
\par
"Second, both soil classes comprise about 30\% of the training and the validation area each (Table 1). Thus, due to this large spatial extent, the selection of features, which describe the structure of the dataset (as derived by PCA) seems to be relevant for prediction, or at least does not seem to have a negative influence." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=10}{Behrens et al 2010:184})
\par
"Another interesting aspect concerningfilter sizes is, that for some soil classes (i.e. S2 and S4), nearly all relevant attributes vary substantially in optimal scale in terms of the ANOVA F-value, whereas, for some other soil classes (i.e. S1 and S3), this effect is comparatively moderate." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=10}{Behrens et al 2010:184})
\par
"This again seems to be related to the shape of areas occupied by thesesoilclasses" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=10}{Behrens et al 2010:184})
\par
"Hence, thefilter effect increases in cases where the area of the soil class is large compared to the resolution of the DEM. In cases where the shape of the soil class is elongated and/or the soil class is comparatively small, the beneficial effect of the multi-scale approach is limited." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YXXQVUK7?page=10}{Behrens et al 2010:184})

  abstract = {Landscape characteristics show local, regional and supra-regional components. As a result pedogenesis and the spatial distribution of soil properties are both influenced by features emerging at multiple scales. To account for this effect in a predictive model, descriptors of the geomorphic signature are required at multiple scales. In this study, we present a new hyper-scale terrain analysis approach, referred to as Contextual Statistical Mapping (ConStat), which is based on statistical neighborhood measures derived for growing sparse circular neighborhoods. The statistical measures tested comprise basic descriptors such as the minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and skewness, as well as statistical terrain attributes and directional components. We propose a data mining framework to determine the relevant statistical measures at the relevant scales to analyze and interpret the influence of these statistical measures and to map the geomorphic structures influencing soil formation and the regions where a statistical measure shows influence. We introduce ConStat on two landscape-scale DSM examples with different soil genesis regimes where the ConStat terrain features serve as proxies for multi-scale variations of climate and parent material conditions. The results show that ConStat provides high predictive power. The cross-validated R2 values range from 0.63 for predicting topsoil clay content in the Piracicaba area (Brazil) to 0.68 for topsoil silt content in the Rhine-Hesse area (Germany). The results obtained from data mining analysis allow for interpretations beyond conventional concepts and approaches to explain soil formation. As such it overcomes the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability of soil property predictions.},

  abstract = {We present a contextual spatial modelling (CSM) framework, as a methodology for multiscale, hierarchical mapping and analysis. The aim is to propose and evaluate a practical method that can account for the complex interactions of environmental covariates across multiple scales and their influence on soil formation. Here we derived common terrain attributes from multiscale versions of a DEM based on up-sampled octaves of the Gaussian pyramid. Because the CSM approach is based on a relatively small set of scales and terrain attributes it is efficient, and depending on the regression algorithm and the covariates used in the modelling, the results can be interpreted in terms of soil formation. Cross-validation coefficient of determination modelling (R2), for predictions of clay and silt increased from 0.38 and 0.16 when using the covariates derived at the original DEM resolution to 0.68 and 0.63, respectively, when using CSM. These results are similar to those achieved with the hyperscale covariates of ConMap and ConStat. As with these hyperscale covariates, the multiscale covariates derived from the Gaussian scale space in CSM capture the observed spatial dependencies and interactions of the landscape and soil. However, some advantages of CSM approach compared to ConMap and ConStat are i) a reduced set of scales that still manage to represent the entire extent of the range of scales, ii) a reduced set of attributes at each scale, iii) more efficient computation, and iv) better interpretability of the important covariates used in the modelling and thus of the factors that affect soil formation.},

"We compared different methods of multi-scale terrain feature construction and their relative effectiveness for digital soil mapping with a Deep Learning algorithm." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=1}{Behrens et al 2018:1})
\par
"The most common approach for multi-scale feature construction in DSM is to filter terrain attributes based on different neighborhood sizes, however results can be difficult to interpret because the approach is affected by outliers." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=1}{Behrens et al 2018:1})
\par
"Here, we introduce 'mixed scaling' a new method that overcomes these issues and preserves the landscape features that are identifiable at different scales." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=1}{Behrens et al 2018:1})
\par
"In our extended implementation of the Gaussian pyramid, we tested four intermediate scales between any two consecutive octaves of the Gaussian pyramid and modelled the data with Deep Learning and Random Forests." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=1}{Behrens et al 2018:1})
\par
"Interactions of environmental covariates occur at multiple scales, influencing the genesis and spatial dependency of soil and other environmental properties. Therefore, it is imperative to account for the essential process scales relevant for soil property genesis in digital soil mapping (DSM) and ecological spatial modelling more generally1-4." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=1}{Behrens et al 2018:1})
\par
"Several approaches have been described to derive scaled versions of environmental covariates. The most common approach has been to use expanding convolution kernels to filter covariates, and especially terrain attributes, with low-pass filters2,5,6, which can produce artifacts related to outliers and the type of filter used7. Another approach, which is frequently used is the calculation of terrain attributes based on finite differences8-10. Both concepts are limited to relatively small neighbourhood sizes or specific terrain attributes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=1}{Behrens et al 2018:1})
\par
"Recently, Deep Learning (DL) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are becoming more popular in various scientific disciplines30-33, but have not yet~been used for DSM. The term 'deep' refers to the complexity of the network. The advantages of DL over common ANN are that DL supports more sophisticated modelling and permits the easy use of large amounts of computational resources for training such models34." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=2}{Behrens et al 2018:2})
\par
"The DL maps have better spatial detail and show finer spatial structures compared to RF." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=3}{Behrens et al 2018:3})
\par
"3. Comparison of the scaling approaches tested in this study. Terrain scaling (A) and (B) decomposes the terrain attributes based on different filtering approaches; DEM scaling decomposes the DEM and derives the multi-scale versions of the terrain attributes based on the decomposed DEMs; mixed scaling downscales the DEM, then drives and upscales the terrain attributes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=4}{Behrens et al 2018:4})
\par
"Multi-scale analysis using mixed-scaling can be viewed as a general-purpose approach for spatial prediction and modelling of any size of area at any resolution." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=4}{Behrens et al 2018:4})
\par
"Behrens et al. (2018) showed that depending on the approach to derive scaled versions of terrain attributes different artifacts can occur. For example filter-based approaches16,40, which might lead to results which cannot be interpreted pedologically. This stems from the fact that the filtering approach is sensitive to outliers." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=7}{Behrens et al 2018:7})
\par
"In DEM scaling7 (Fig.~3C), the terrain attributes are derived on scaled versions of the DEM," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=7}{Behrens et al 2018:7})
\par
"Then the generalized terrain attributes and not the DEM, are then upscaled back to the original resolution. The advantages of this method are more interpretable and intuitive terrain attributes that lead to more accurate interpretations of the spatial patterns and less artifacts compared to terrain scaling and DEM scaling (Figs~1 and 2)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=7}{Behrens et al 2018:7})
\par
"We use RF as the reference method for building regression models between the multi-scale features and the soil properties22,23. A tree in a RF model is build by recursive partitioning of the training dataset. In RF many trees are aggregated by averaging (regression) or majority vote (classification). The trees differ by the number of instances of the training dataset used for each tree, which is based on a bootstrap sample and the number of independent variables randomly tested at each split in each tree. This combination of randomization effects leads to robust and accurate prediction results22." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=7}{Behrens et al 2018:7})
\par
"We used the H2O implementation of DL, which is based on a multi-layer feed-forward artificial neural network that is trained with stochastic gradient descent using back-propagation53." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=7}{Behrens et al 2018:7})
\par
"networks. Apart from the number of folds for cross-validation, which we set to 10, all other parameters were set to their default" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=7}{Behrens et al 2018:7})
\par
"All multi-scale predictors were standardized, by subtracting the mean (centering) and dividing by the standard deviation (scaling), resulting in a standard normal distributions. This is important because the ranges of the predictors at different scales can show large differences. This is especially the case for the terrain scaling because due to the filtering effect the ranges of the values constantly decreases over the scales. The reason for standardization is to avoid the model being dominated by variables that appear to have larger variances relative to other attributes as a matter of scale, rather than true contribution5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=7}{Behrens et al 2018:7})
\par
"Our implementation of RF used the R package 'caret'57 for grid learning and cross-validation58. For DL we used the cross-validation function of the H20 package53. We reported the average R2 cross-validation accuracy of the ten model validation runs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=7}{Behrens et al 2018:7})
\par
"We used Moran's I (MI) to analyze the efficacy of the modelling approaches to eliminate spatial auto-correlation in the residuals using the mixed scaling eGP approach." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KPSNNV99?page=7}{Behrens et al 2018:7})

  abstract = {In pedology, spatial context is relevant to soil-landscape systems on at least three different scales: i) the scale of quasi-local processes, which are independent of influence from the direct or wider neighborhood, ii) the scale of short-range processes for example on the local hillslope or catena, and iii) the scale of long-range processes, or teleconnected systems. We can represent the effects of teleconnections using existing tools and covariates, but we cannot easily infer or identify their controls, landscape processes or landscape units. We consider that an ability to identify the relevant controls in teleconnected systems would greatly improve pedological interpretation and understanding. Such understanding relates to the interaction of environmental factors and processes in the spatial context, which is relevant for environmental mapping generally. Here we show that teleconnected systems can be disassembled and interpreted using contextual modelling in such a way that the controls, i.e. the cause, can be localized in space. We present examples of how teleconnected systems can be deciphered. The methodology is based on the previously described ConMap approach in combination with Random Forest's measures of local feature importance. ConMap uses elevation differences, computed along multiple rays radiating out from a center grid cell, as predictors instead of complex surface derivatives or decomposed scales of a digital elevation model (DEM) or terrain attribute. Using synthetic and real-world data sets, we show how to identify and interpret teleconnections in soil environmental systems. In the synthetic example, elevation peaks are shown to produce larger values of soil properties, while, in contrast, a valley-mountain system is the main control of soil texture in the real-world example. Our analyses of teleconnected soil environmental systems illustrate that the stochastic component of the universal model of spatial variation is an integral but typically unresolved part of the deterministic component.},

Attempts have been made by the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the NT to restrict the intrusion by creating physical earth barrages. In this study the use of Airborne Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar for mapping soil salinity is examined. Three dielectric retrieval algorithms, the Small Perturbation, Physical Optics, and Dubois models have been implemented, and the results of these were combined to retrieve an improved estimate of the magnitude of the imaginary part of the complex dielectric constant for soil salinity discrimination. An efficient data selection process was employed to allow application of these models in this natural environment. Vegetation correction to the small perturbation and physical optics models before combination with the Dubois model improved classification accuracy in the semivegetated areas.

Plant protection has been focused on the concept of control, mainly utilizing chemical or biological arsenals, and more recently, the biotechnological. The application of ecological criteria in plant protection has allowed the implementation of the biofumigation processes, a technique based on the utilization of gases produced during the biodescomposition of organic matter to manage soilborne phytopathogenic organisms. It is hoped that future improvements in agriculture will consider the increasing worries related to the environment, the conservation of the natural resources, public health, and highlighting attention of the importance of agriculture in the elimination of poverty, as well as its contribution to the development of biofuels.},

This discussion paper sets the scene for an Australian Soil Security framework as an example of how it might be developed for any country, defining the key issues and justification for Soil Security, as well as detailing implementation requirements and benefits; two examples of beneficial outcomes are provided in terms of facilitating decommoditization of agricultural products and the impact of urban encroachment on productive land. We highlight research gaps, where new knowledge will contribute to well-rounded approaches that reflect differing stakeholder perspectives.

  abstract = {Soil drainage constitutes a substantial factor affecting plant growth and various biophysical processes, such as nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes. Consequently, soil drainage maps represent crucial tools for crop, forest and environmental management purposes. As extensive field surveys are time- and resource-consuming, alternative spatial modelling techniques have been previously applied for predicting soil drainage classes. The present study assessed the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for mapping soil drainage classes in Denmark and compared it to a Decision Tree Classification (DTC) technique. 1702 soil observations and 31 environmental variables, including soil and terrain parameters, and spectral indices derived from satellite images, were utilized as input data. Based on a 33\% holdback validation dataset, the best performing ANN and DTC models yielded overall accuracy values of 54 and 52\%, respectively. DTC models benefited from the use of all variables, but ANN models performed better after variable selection. Notably, ANN and DTC model performances were comparable although differential costs for misclassification were only implemented for DTC modelling. Nevertheless, both methods produced predictive drainage maps in accordance with one another and demonstrated promising classification abilities over a large study area (c. 43,000 km2).},

  abstract = {The development and implementation of a national data schema for soil data in Australia over the last two decades, coupled with advances in information technology, has led to the realisation of more comprehensive state and national soil databases. This has facilitated increased access to soil data for many purposes, including the creation of many digital soil-mapping products, such as the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia. Consequently, users of soil data have a growing need for clarity concerning the quality of the data; many new users have little understanding of the varying quality of the data. To date, statements about the quality of primary soil data have typically been qualitative and/or judgemental rather than explicit. The consequences of poor-quality primary data and of the lack of a coding system for data quality are growing with increased usage and with demand for soil data at the regional to national scale. Pillar 4 of the Global Soil Partnership and the National Soil Research, Development and Extension Strategy both identify the need to improve the quality of soil data. Various international standards do exist with respect to the quality of soil data but these tend to focus on general principles and quality-assurance frameworks rather than the detail of describing data quality. The aim of this paper is to stimulate a discussion in the Australian soil science community on how to quantify and describe the quality of primary soil data. We provide examples of the data quality issues and propose a framework for structured data-quality checking procedures and quality coding of soil morphological and analytical data in Australia.},

  abstract = {One of the purposes of a soil map is to present information regarding the spatial variation of soil to the end user. In the past, statistical methods of uncertainty have been used to indicate map quality. In this paper, the information content of a map is proposed as a more suitable measure of map quality. The theory has its basis in information theory, more particularly Shannon’s information criterion. A modification of Shannon’s information criterion is presented. Other than being used as an indicator of map quality, the method is particularly useful as an aid during the map production process, for example, choosing block size or grid spacing. Four examples illustrate the concept and its potential use in soil science. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In this study we validated digital soil maps of clay content at different spatial supports; point, 48 m blocks and soil–land use complexes (SLU). The aim being to examine the change in prediction quality with different prediction supports. Digital soil maps of clay content at depths of 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm and 30–50 cm were created using linear mixed models, legacy soil data and readily available covariates such as digital terrain attributes, landsat and gamma radiometrics. A random stratified sampling design was used to collect an independent validation dataset. There was little change in the accuracy between the point (RMSE = 15.7\% for 0–10 cm, 17.4\% for 10–30 cm, 15.2\% for 30–50 cm) and 48 m block supports (RMSE = 15.5\% for 0–10 cm, 17.1\% for 10–30 cm, 13.5\% for 30–50 cm). However the prediction quality was much improved at the support of the SLUs (RMSE = 9.5\% for 0–10 cm, 10.1\% for 10–30 cm and 5.1\% for 30–50 cm). It is a standard practice in digital soil mapping studies to validate at the point support but our results show that this is likely to represent the worst case scenario for assessing their prediction quality. Further work should consider finding optimal prediction supports for creating digital soil maps.},

  abstract = {Sampling design (SD) plays a crucial role in providing reliable input for digital soil mapping (DSM) and increasing its efficiency. Sampling design, with a predetermined sample size and consideration of budget and spatial variability, is a selection procedure for identifying a set of sample locations spread over a geographical space or with a good feature space coverage. A good feature space coverage ensures accurate estimation of regression parameters, while spatial coverage contributes to effective spatial interpolation. First, we review several statistical and geometric SDs that mainly optimize the sampling pattern in a geographical space and illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of these SDs by considering spatial coverage, simplicity, accuracy, and efficiency. Furthermore, Latin hypercube sampling, which obtains a full representation of multivariate distribution in geographical space, is described in detail for its development, improvement, and application. In addition, we discuss the fuzzy k-means sampling, response surface sampling, and Kennard-Stone sampling, which optimize sampling patterns in a feature space. We then discuss some practical applications that are mainly addressed by the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling with the flexibility and feasibility of adding multiple optimization criteria. We also discuss different methods of validation, an important stage of DSM, and conclude that an independent dataset selected from the probability sampling is superior for its free model assumptions. For future work, we recommend: 1) exploring SDs with both good spatial coverage and feature space coverage; 2) uncovering the real impacts of an SD on the integral DSM procedure; and 3) testing the feasibility and contribution of SDs in three-dimensional (3D) DSM with variability for multiple layers.},

Geomorphological, it indicates the changing rate of the slope or of the orientation per unit lenght, in the XY plan. There are many types of curvatures, but in the more important morphometric analyses they are the following: profile curvature, plan curvature, tangential curvature, longitudinal curvature, transverse curvature, maximum curvature, minimum curvature, medial curvature, general curvature. This article aims at highlighting the differentiations that appear in the qualitative interpretation, in a geomorphologic sense, the results of the processing curvatures’ varieties in a series of GIS type programmes. At the same time, we had as our goal, the identification of the causes for these interpretative disparities, causes that are found in the mathematical apparatus used at the elaboration of the algorithms for extracting the curvature values and in the ambiguities concerning their definition.},

These approaches to analysing imagery have antecedents in earlier research on image segmentation and use GIS-like spatial analysis within classification and feature extraction approaches. This article investigates these development and its implications and asks whether or not this is a new paradigm in remote sensing and Geographic Information Science (GIScience). We first discuss several limitations of prevailing per-pixel methods when applied to high resolution images. Then we explore the paradigm concept developed by Kuhn (1962) and discuss whether GEOBIA can be regarded as a paradigm according to this definition. We crystallize core concepts of GEOBIA, including the role of objects, of ontologies and the multiplicity of scales and we discuss how these conceptual developments support important methods in remote sensing such as change detection and accuracy assessment. The ramifications of the different theoretical foundations between the ‘per-pixel paradigm’ and GEOBIA are analysed, as are some of the challenges along this path from pixels, to objects, to geo-intelligence. Based on several paradigm indications as defined by Kuhn and based on an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature we conclude that GEOBIA is a new and evolving paradigm.},

A representative selection of eight regional test areas covers a pan-European network and allows comparative investigations to provide accepted recommendations for regional and European nature conservation. The selected results of four case studies are presented and discussed. The range of work covers the production of regional and local habitat maps by object-oriented classification, a case-based reasoning method for change detection as a management support tool for planning and regulating local land use, the selection and application of structural indicators for the monitoring of Natura 2000 habitats and the downscaling and disaggregation of soil information. Results and the further implementation of presented methods are discussed in the conclusions.},

"Until fairly recently, traditional soil survey was based largely on interpretation of aerial photography verified with field observations. Map unit concepts were" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=37}{Boettinger 2010:37})
\par
"sometimes applied inconsistently across survey areas, with different soil scientists having different interpretations of soil-landscape relationships. Locations of pedon descriptions, transects, traverses, and observations were difficult to accurately georeference. Map unit concepts and rules of application were rarely documented and archived in places other than the minds of the soil scientists who moved on to map soils in other areas, making soil survey updates more difficult and time-consuming." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=38}{Boettinger 2010:38})
\par
"The goal is to represent all scorpan factors - environmental covariates - with spatially explicit digital data, assemble existing (legacy) and/or collect new georeferenced field and laboratory soil data, fit quantitative relationships, and predict the spatial distribution of soil classes and/or attributes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=39}{Boettinger 2010:39})
\par
"However, the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), which is similar to NDVI but includes a correction factor ("L") for soil, has also been used (e.g., Section 6.2.2)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=41}{Boettinger 2010:41})

"Green) was thought to represent variations in carbonates, Band 3 (Red) / Band 7 (longer wavelength SWIR) was thought to represent iron, and Band 5 (shorter wavelength SWIR) / Band 7 (longer wavelength SWIR) was thought to represent hydroxyls of clays." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=43}{Boettinger 2010:43})
\par
"While these exact physical relationships may not be valid for all study areas, these simple band ratios illustrate and help quantify mineralogical diversity of the soils and parent material on the landscape (e.g., Boettinger et al., 2008)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=43}{Boettinger 2010:43})
\par
"While rasterized vector coverages of bedrock and surficial geology may be useful covariates, spectral reflectance better quantifies the mineralogy and spatial position of the parent material." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=43}{Boettinger 2010:43})
\par
"The digital representation of the Earth's surface by terrain attributes is largely dependent on the scale at which they are computed" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=71}{Boettinger 2010:71})
\par
"Typically the effects of scale on terrain attributes have only been investigated as a function of digital elevation model (DEM) grid size, rather than the neighborhood size over which they are computed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=71}{Boettinger 2010:71})
\par
"a multi-scale terrain analysis approach may be a more viable option to filter out the large amount short-range variation present within them" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=71}{Boettinger 2010:71})
\par
"The first study was designed to evaluate the systematic effects of varying both grid and neighborhood size on terrain attributes computed from LiDAR. In a second study, the objective was to examine how the correlations between soil and terrain attributes vary with neighborhood size, so as to provide an empirical measure of what neighborhood size may be most appropriate" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=71}{Boettinger 2010:71})
\par
"In hopes of explaining more soil variation with terrain attributes, research has sought to improve their digital representation by evaluating the numerous methods for generating DEM (Chaplot et al., 2006), and the algorithms used to derive terrain attributes from them (Florinsky, 1998)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=72}{Boettinger 2010:72})
\par
"Perhaps the most significant source of error in DSM is attributable to the scale at which the Earth's surface is represented by terrain attributes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=72}{Boettinger 2010:72})
\par
"Also, finer resolutions (5-10 m), in particular, do not produce more accurate predictions, but instead introduce excessive detail which is difficult to characterize with conventional automated methods (see Section 27.5.2)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=72}{Boettinger 2010:72})
\par
"An alternative to coarsening the resolution of a DEM to match the scale of the soil-landscape processes being mimicked by terrain attributes is multi-scale terrain characterization. This alternative approach was first suggested by Wood (1996), whereby the window size used to calculate terrain attributes from a DEM is set by the user." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=72}{Boettinger 2010:72})
\par
"The application of this approach has been demonstrated in a few instances, and it has been shown that soil-landscape relationships vary with neighborhood size (Park et al., 2001; Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004; Smith et al., 2006)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=72}{Boettinger 2010:72})
\par
"One case study was designed to evaluate the systematic effects of varying both grid and neighborhood size on terrain attributes computed from LiDAR. In a second case study, the objective was to examine how the correlations between soil and terrain attributes vary with neighborhood size, so as to provide an empirical measure of what neighborhood size may be most appropriate." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=73}{Boettinger 2010:73})
\par
"specific DEM resampling and terrain attribute calculation procedures were used." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=74}{Boettinger 2010:74})
\par
"As slope aspect is a circular measure, its values are not suitable for direct comparison. Therefore, slope aspect was transformed to northerness by, Northerness = |180− Aspect|" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=74}{Boettinger 2010:74})
\par
"Within this watershed a soil dataset was available with which to examine the effect of neighborhood size on correlations between soil properties and terrain attributes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=75}{Boettinger 2010:75})
\par
"The stratifying variables used were geology (62\% sandstone, 11\% shale/sandstone, and 26 \% shale), elevation (three quantile classes), and stream power index (five quantile classes). The intersection of these variables created 45 unique strata, within which two random sites were sampled." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=75}{Boettinger 2010:75})
\par
"In order to avoid sampling extraneous features, exclusion rules were used to avoid roads (buffered to 20 m), streams (buffered to 10 m), developed areas, and patches of strata smaller than 4,000 m2 (approximately 1 acre)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=75}{Boettinger 2010:75})
\par
"Procedures outlined by Florinsky and Kuryankova (2000) were used to examine the variation in environmental correlation between soil properties and terrain attributes when altering the neighborhood size used to calculate the terrain attributes from a high-resolution DEM" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=75}{Boettinger 2010:75})
\par
"This procedure involves plotting the goodness of fit (correlation coefficient, r ) between selected soil properties and individual terrain attributes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=75}{Boettinger 2010:75})
\par
"over a span of neighborhood sizes, and identifying the range in neighborhood size that occupies a smooth portion within the plots. Such an area of the correlation plot where the correlation values are relatively invariant as neighborhood size increases represents a range in scales where soil properties exhibit less spatial heterogeneity and more predictable variability, providing for more reproducible and interpretable results (Florinsky and Kuryankova, 2000)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=76}{Boettinger 2010:76})
\par
"With increasing neighborhood size, the landscape features that are represented by the terrain attributes correspond more closely to recognizable landform elements (Fig. 5.2b and c), such as drainageways, footslopes, backslopes, and shoulders." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"At these intermediate neighborhood sizes (e.g., 15-81 m), the terrain attributes represent a smoother but more connected landscape (Fig. 5.2b and c)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"This smoothing of the landscape representation is also seen in the boxplots (Fig. 5.3)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"where the median value remains relatively stable, but the interquartile range decreases and the outliers become less extreme." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"When larger neighborhood sizes are used (e.g., {$>$} 81 m), the landscape features depicted by the terrain attributes become oversimplified (Fig. 5.2d). When the neighborhood size becomes significantly large, the smoothing of the landscape increases and the terrain attributes may misrepresent landform elements because the neighborhood includes DEM data from outside the local landscape (e.g., from across a watershed divide)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"This distortion or oversimplification of the landscape represented by the terrain attributes appears in the boxplots of slope gradient by a loss in the stability in the median value and continued decrease in the maximum value above a neighborhood size of 81 m (Fig. 5.3a and e)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"The effects of changing neighborhood size on derived terrain attributes is not the same for the two landscapes examined in this case study" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"While terrain attributes are affected by neighborhood size, the effect of grid size appears to be negligible." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"These and other observations suggest that slope gradient is not sensitive to the effect of spatial extent up until 81- m. For these landscapes, it appears that a neighborhood size of 81-m corresponds with the threshold beyond which all the terrain attributes become increasingly less representative of the original landscape." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"The goodness of fit measures (MD, RMSD, r ) quantify the similarity of the terrain attributes derived from a given neighborhood size to the terrain attributes calculated using the nearest neighbors in the DEM. As such, higher MD and RMSD values and lower r values indicate greater differences between the two paired data" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=77}{Boettinger 2010:77})
\par
"First, even small increases in neighborhood size lead to larger differences in the terrain attribute values, and therefore the representation of the landscape features." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=79}{Boettinger 2010:79})
\par
"The results show that the correlation between the soil properties and surface curvatures are the most sensitive to the effects of neighborhood size (Fig. 5.5)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=81}{Boettinger 2010:81})
\par
"That the correlations between the soil properties and surface curvatures were optimized is important because slope curvatures have the strongest correlation coefficients in most cases." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=81}{Boettinger 2010:81})
\par
"Increasing the neighborhood size used to derive terrain attributes had less of an effect on slope gradient than on slope curvature (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4). Consequently, correlation coefficients between soil properties and slope gradient do not appear to be sensitive to the effect of neighborhood size." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=81}{Boettinger 2010:81})
\par
"The spatial extent over which terrain attributes are derived has a considerable effect on their representation of the land surface and correlation with soil attributes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=81}{Boettinger 2010:81})
\par
"In the first study described here, it was shown that using a larger neighborhood size has a similar effect as using a larger grid size, without the unnecessary loss of detail caused by using a larger grid size." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=81}{Boettinger 2010:81})
\par
"To help determine what neighborhood size might be most appropriate for DSM, the simple exploratory procedures used here proved to be informative." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=81}{Boettinger 2010:81})
\par
"Within the second study described here the correlation between the soil attributes and surface curvatures was optimized by increasing the neighborhood size." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=81}{Boettinger 2010:81})
\par
"One of the questions being posed in this study is how comparable is a third-order soil map created by the conventional soil survey approach to one created via digital soil mapping." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=367}{Boettinger 2010:367})
\par
"To compare the two mapping approaches the subgroup level of Soil Taxonomy was chosen as the response variable and the map unit as the unit of comparison" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=367}{Boettinger 2010:367})
\par
"Within each map unit the proportion and number of subgroups predicted by each mapping approach was qualitatively compared." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=367}{Boettinger 2010:367})
\par
"Research in digital soil mapping has indicated that its methodologies (i.e., pedometric techniques) could be successfully extended to a field setting, where they could enhance the quality and scientific foundation of soil surveys, as well as save time and money" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=367}{Boettinger 2010:367})
\par
"One of the questions posed in this study, is how comparable are maps of soil types created by conventional soil" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=367}{Boettinger 2010:367})
\par
"Fundamentally both approaches to soil mapping are similar in that they make use of relationships between the soil and more readily observable land surface properties, such as shape, position, and reflectance." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=368}{Boettinger 2010:368})
\par
"Beyond this, both can take different approaches to all aspects of soil mapping, including project planning and preparation, sampling design, field operation, soil measurement, predictive modeling, and geographic representation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=368}{Boettinger 2010:368})
\par
"Ultimately these differences mean that any comparison between these two approaches cannot be wholly quantitative, unless based on an estimate of the amount of variance explained by each of these methods for predicting soil properties" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=368}{Boettinger 2010:368})
\par
"Although much has been written on the benefits of digital soil mapping relative to conventional soil survey, few studies have directly compared the accuracy of both approaches for predicting soil classes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=368}{Boettinger 2010:368})
\par
"Bell et al. (1994) found general agreement (67\%) between a soil survey and a quantitative soil-landscape model based on parent material, terrain attributes, and surface drainage feature proximity." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=368}{Boettinger 2010:368})
\par
"First, these studies demonstrate that regardless of the soil mapping approach a large amount of unexplained variability remains, which is to be expected given the limitations of our pedogenic models (Wilding, 1994)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=368}{Boettinger 2010:368})
\par
"Second, many authors assume that they would expect greater accuracies with better spatial data for model development" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=368}{Boettinger 2010:368})
\par
"However in our experience (Howell et al., 2008), simply increasing the spatial and spectral resolution of our spatial data has not dramatically improved our results. Third, digital soil mapping provides more spatially explicit and detailed estimates of soil spatial variability." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=368}{Boettinger 2010:368})
\par
"While digital soil mapping is limited by the resolution of the spatial data, the conventional approach is limited by the scale of the base map and the inability to represent continuous spatial variation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=368}{Boettinger 2010:368})
\par
"data, and therefore can not readily incorporate the existing pedogenic knowledge of soil scientists (McKenzie et al., 2000)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=369}{Boettinger 2010:369})
\par
"Following the example of McKenzie et al. (2000), a combination of stratifiedrandom and purposive sites were sampled (Fig. 29.2)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=370}{Boettinger 2010:370})
\par
"This approach was chosen to reduce sampling bias while ensuring that areas of known pedogenic significance were not overlooked." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=370}{Boettinger 2010:370})
\par
"A limited set of stratifying variables were chosen that conformed to the existing pedogenic knowledge of the area." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=370}{Boettinger 2010:370})
\par
"For both domains the band ratios used for stratification were derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and designed to enhance iron (3/7), carbonates (3/2), and clay (5/7)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=370}{Boettinger 2010:370})
\par
"This classification suggested five classes for each domain, which were then used to create a signature file and classify the remaining study area using maximum likelihood classification." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=371}{Boettinger 2010:371})
\par
"The intersection of these variables produced sixteen strata." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=371}{Boettinger 2010:371})
\par
"After a series of exclusion rules were used to mask unrepresentative and inaccessible areas, a total of 62 random sites were generated using Hawth's Analysis Tools for ArcGIS (Hawthorne, 2009), and apportioned amongst the strata proportional to area" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=371}{Boettinger 2010:371})
\par
"The Soil Survey Project Leader determined that several distinct landforms were under-represented, thus 16 additional purposive sites was also sampled." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=371}{Boettinger 2010:371})
\par
"At all sites, a soil pit was excavated to 150 cm or a limiting layer, described according to Schoeneberger et al. (2002), and classified according to Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2006)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=371}{Boettinger 2010:371})
\par
"Once delineated, the percentage of major and minor ({$<$}15\% of unit) landform components of each soil mapping unit were estimated by visually studying the imagery or by field reconnaissance." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=371}{Boettinger 2010:371})
\par
"The environmental covariates used in this study included a wide range of predictive variables, listed in Table 29.1. The primary data sources for these covariates were a 5-m DEM derived from interferometric synethic aperature radar (IFSAR), multispectral imagery acquired from Landsat ETM+ on the 6th of July 2000 from path 39 and row 36, and climate data interpolated by Michaelsen (2002a, b, c, d). Prior to computing the terrain attributes, the DEM was resampled from its original horizontal resolution of 5-15-m using the nearest neighbor method and hydrologically corrected using the impact reduction technique implemented within the Terrain Analysis System (TAS) (Lindsay, 2005). To compute the geometric terrain attributes Landserf (Wood, 2008) was used, while for the hydrologic and topo-climatic terrain attributes SAGA (Bock et al., 2008) was used. For the purposes of spatial analysis all of the environmental covariates, other than the terrain attributes were resampled to common grid size of 15-m by cubic convolution" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=372}{Boettinger 2010:372})
\par
"To assess the two soil mapping approaches a qualitative comparison was made of the proportion and number of soil types estimated by each mapping approach within the map units delineated by the conventional approach. For the digital soil mapping approach this was estimated by intersecting the output of the random forest with the map unit polygons." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=372}{Boettinger 2010:372})
\par
"The soil type estimated within each map unit was the subgroup level of Soil Taxonomy. This taxonomic level was chosen because it has a good balance between its overall number of classes and the amount of information contained within them." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=372}{Boettinger 2010:372})
\par
"While sites were sampled across the entire study area only seven map units (Table 29.4) were developed for approximately 75\% of the study area, using 51 observations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=372}{Boettinger 2010:372})
\par
"In comparison the random forest was trained on all 78 observations, which would seem to suggest that digital soil mapping can make more efficient use of soil observations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=375}{Boettinger 2010:375})
\par
"This would be a naïve interpretation though, as soil scientists often take into account soil-landscape relationships observed elsewhere, assuming that similar soil-forming factors exist. Extrapolation of soil-landscapes relationships within soil survey is practiced when dealing with inaccessible lands in remote areas, which is a common problem within the western United States" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=375}{Boettinger 2010:375})
\par
"Due to the low frequency of most classes, those with less than five observations were incorrectly classified" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=375}{Boettinger 2010:375})
\par
"However in many cases the incorrect class was a similar soil or occurred in a similar landscape position." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZJCY6YPG?page=375}{Boettinger 2010:375})

The method uses a digital terrain model (DTM) of the area and regionalised climate data to derive the soil regionalised variables that form the basis of the prediction. The method was tested using 94 soil profile samples in the Quaternary stratum of the Schatterbach test site, a 2387 ha investigation area in the Bavarian Tertiary Hills (Germany). The approach is based on the assumption that the shape of the landscape and the late Quaternary climate history determines slope development and soil forming processes. To develop the method, a suite of terrain- indices and complex process parameters was derived from DTM and climate data. Step-wise linear regression was then used to identify which of these terrain indices and process parameters were most useful in predicting the required soil attributes. Testing of the approach showed that 88.1\% of the variance was explained by a combination of the sediment transport, mass balance and solifluction parameters, providing a sound basis for the prediction of soil parameters in hilly terrain.},

In viticulture, climate mainly governs grapevine development rate and berry ripening. The aim of the present work is to characterise climate spatial variability at mesoscale level, using several spatialization techniques at daily time step, applied to climate variables and agroclimatic indices, in order to evaluate its consequences on grapevine development and grape ripening. This study was led in the Bordeaux winegrowing region. Six variables were studied: minimum and maximum temperatures, solar radiation, reference evapotranspiration, rainfall and soil water balance. For each variable, the method providing the best results (i.e. the lowest errors) with reasonable computational and time costs was selected. The propagation of spatialization errors within agroclimatic models was assessed. The error propagation is considerable within degree-days and soil water balance models. Maps of climate variables and agroclimatic indices were used to analyse the spatial characteristics of climate within the Bordeaux winegrowing area and to quantify differences that were known only from indirect and empirical observations. This study provides useful information to enhance the choice of viticultural techniques and plant material in relation to the local environment.},

  abstract = {The identification of viticulture terroir is an important issue, strongly rooted on soil science, that has major impact on vineyard management and, through marketing, on farmer income. The concept of terroir is well established but still ambiguous. Nowadays, a unique methodology to the analysis and implementation of terroirs does not exist but most of the approaches are based on a landscape classification employing multicriteria qualitative parametric models. This work departs from these empirical models and it attempts to prove that a mechanistic approach (strongly based on hydropedology) to the analysis of terroir is feasible and it enables a better use of environmental features with respect to plant requirement and wine production. More specifically, the proposed approach aims to integrate the standard terroir analysis with soil–plant–atmosphere water balance simulation modelling and GIS databases in order to ameliorate the spatial analysis of terroirs. The study has been conducted in a test area located in the central part of the Campania region: the Valle Telesina (BN) (about 20,000 ha). This area has a long tradition in the production of high quality wines (DOC and DOCG) and it is characterised by a complex geomorphology with a large soil and climate variabilities.},

Thus, understanding how suitability for viticulture is changing under CC is of primary interest in the development of adaptation strategies in traditional winegrowing regions. Considering that climate is an essential part of the terroir system, the expected variability in climate change could have a marked influence on terroir resilience with important effects on local farming communities in viticultural regions.},

  abstract = {Land use assessment is among the practical purposes of soil classification. Several researches has been specifically focused on the use of conventional surveys in the evaluation of soil suitability for agriculture products whose quality is influenced by the interactions between soil, plants and the biological stock of the rhizosphere. Our aim was to expand the application of the soil suitability protocol by relating soil types with biodiversity and the ecological equilibria of biological communities. This goal can be pursued by combining the approaches to soil type delineation with the techniques of quantitative ecology that are based on the similarity theory. Given the qualitative scale of several field-recorded attributes make their numerical processing difficult, we focused on numerical techniques for multivariate sets of data to combine with geostatistics. We thought these techniques would originate local soil classes meaningful in terms of both soil processes and soil suitability evaluation. Since auger boring data are formally comparable to vegetation data, we tested Goodall's and Burnaby's pairwise similarity indexes: the former assumes that pairs of observations sharing an infrequent value are more similar than pairs which share more frequent values; the latter considers associations among attributes, giving higher weights to independent ones.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

However, the accuracy assessment of such predictive models in a spatial context needs to account for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in geospatial data by using spatial cross-validation and bootstrap strategies instead of their now more widely used non-spatial equivalent. These spatial resampling-based estimation procedures were therefore implemented in a new package ‘sperrorest’ for the opensource statistical data analysis software R.

  abstract = {Soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling have been important drivers in the advancement of our understanding of soil from the earliest days of the scientific study of soils. Soil maps were desirable for purposes of land valuation for taxation, agronomic planning, and even in military operations. Soil mapping required classification systems that would allow communication of mapped information, classification systems required understanding of the soil system, and gaining that understanding included the creation of soil models. Therefore, advancement in one of these highly interrelated areas tended to lead to corresponding advances in the others, and these relationships persist into the modern era. Although many advances in our understanding of the soil system have been made since the late 1800s, when soil science blossomed into a scientific discipline in its own right, there are still many unanswered questions and additional needs in soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling. New technologies including GPS, GIS, remote sensing, on-site geophysical instrumentation (EMI, GPR, PXRF, etc.), and the development of statistical and geostatistical techniques have greatly increased our ability to collect, analyze, and predict spatial information related to soils, but linking all of this new information to soil properties and processes can still be a challenge and enhanced pedologic models are needed. The expansion of the use of soil knowledge to address issues beyond agronomic production, such as land use planning, environmental concerns, food security, energy security, water security, and human health, to name a few, requires new ways to communicate what we know about the soils we map as well as bringing forth research questions that were not widely considered in earlier soils studies. At present this information is communicated using dozens of national soil classification systems as well as WRB, but a more universal soil classification system would facilitate international communication of soils information. There are still many significant needs in the area of soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling going into the future.},

This chapter describes a simple method for selecting such spatial coverage samples. The study area is partitioned into geographically compact subregions from which one point is selected purposively. The partitioning is done by clustering the cells of a fine raster with the k-means clustering algorithm, using the x- and y-coordinates of the midpoints of the cells as classification variables. The centroids of the clusters are used as sample points. The method was tested in two case studies. In the first study, the locations of 23 points were optimised within a square area, and in the second study, 32 points were added to 6 prior points in an irregular shaped area. In both studies, the average kriging variance (AKV) and maximum kriging variance (MaxKV) for the spatial coverage samples were compared with the AKV and MaxKV for the geostatistical samples obtained by directly minimising these criteria with the spatial simulated annealing (SSA) algorithm. The AKV values for the spatial coverage samples and the geostatistical samples obtained with AKV as a minimisation criterion were comparable. If we want to minimise MaxKV, then the SSA procedure is preferable.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in model-based optimization of sampling designs for mapping. This paper is an update of the overview of sampling designs for mapping presented by de Gruijter et al. (2006). For model-based estimation of values at unobserved points (mapping), probability sampling is not required, which opens up the possibility of optimized non-probability sampling. Non-probability sampling designs for mapping are regular grid sampling, spatial coverage sampling, k-means sampling, conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, response surface sampling, Kennard-Stone sampling and model-based sampling. In modelbased sampling a preliminary model of the spatial variation of the soil variable of interest is used for optimizing the sample size and or the spatial coordinates of the sampling locations. Kriging requires knowledge of the variogram. Sampling designs for variogram estimation are nested sampling, independent random sampling of pairs of points, and model-based designs in which either the uncertainty about the variogram parameters, or the uncertainty about the kriging variance is minimized. Various minimization criteria have been proposed for designing a single sample that is suitable both for estimating the variogram and for mapping. For map validation, additional probability sampling is recommended, so that unbiased estimates of map quality indices and their standard errors can be obtained. For all sampling designs, R scripts are available in the supplement. Further research is recommended on sampling designs for mapping with machine learning techniques, designs that are robust against deviations of modeling assumptions, designs tailored at mapping multiple soil variables of interest and soil classes or fuzzy memberships, and probability sampling designs that are efficient both for design-based estimation of populations means and for model-based mapping.},

  abstract = {We propose a numerical method for classification and characterization of landforms on Mars. The method provides an alternative to manual geomorphic mapping of the Martian surface. Digital elevation data is used to calculate several topographic attributes for each pixel in a landscape. Unsupervised classification, based on the self-organizing map technique, divides all pixels into mutually exclusive and exhaustive landform classes on the basis of similarity between attribute vectors. The results are displayed as a thematic map of landforms and statistics of attributes are used to assign semantic meaning to the classes. This method is used to produce a geomorphic map of the Terra Cimmeria region on Mars. We assess the quality of the automated classification and discuss differences between results of automated and manual mappings. Potential applications of our method, including crater counting, landscape feature search, and large scale quantitative comparisons of Martian surface morphology, are identified and evaluated.},

  abstract = {We modelled the distribution of soil properties across the agricultural zone on the Australian continent using data mining and knowledge discovery from databases (DM\&KDD) tools. Piecewise linear tree models were built choosing from 19 climate variables, digital elevation model (DEM) and derived terrain attributes, four Landsat multi-spectral scanner (MSS) bands, land use and lithology maps as predictors of topsoil and subsoil pH, organic C, \% clay, and total N and P. The actual geographic location of the sampled soil data points was not used as a predictor. Classification trees were used to estimate topsoil and subsoil horizon thickness and texture class using similar predictors. That maps could be made using the decision tree models attests to the occurrence of knowledge discovery from the soil point databases used as training data. The decision tree models were evaluated and interpreted in a spatial context by: (1) tabulation of variables selected by the tree models; (2) mapping of the extent over which individual predictors were used and their thresholds; and (3) mapping of the extent over which combinations of predictors were used. The evaluation and interpretation process indicates that the models are consistent with general principles of soil genesis and that detailed investigation of the models’ structure in a spatial context may have other uses in biogeographical studies and geo-ecological process modelling.},

  abstract = {Sealing implies separation of soils from the atmosphere and above-ground biosphere by impermeable layers. Sealing has a strong impact on soils. The degree of sealing is related to the type of land use and to the population density. Sealed areas are still increasing, and it is often the most fertile soils which are sealed. The negative effects of sealing are partial or total loss of soils, e.g. for plant production and habitats, and an increase in floods, as well as an increase in health and social costs. On the other hand, sealed areas contribute hugely to the gross national product of a country. The most effective contributions for reducing soil sealing are expected to come from the engineering sciences. Other contributions could be made by the economic and social sciences. It is also important to address the problem at a political level, e.g. by passing an international convention to prevent soil consumption. Despite all these problems, soils can still exist underneath sealed areas. Their properties can be used to mitigate the negative effects of sealing.},

  abstract = {This article traces the development of conceptual paradigms of soil classification and mapping from the pre-1960's model of crisp classes in attribute space linked to crisply delineated mapping units in geographical space, to modem approaches using fuzzy classification and geostatistical interpolation for simultaneously handling continuous variation in both attributes and location. Continuous classification yields a separate map of class membership values for every class the dominance of any class at each location can be expressed by a confusion index, CI. If spatial correlation is strong, zones of high CI are concentrated in narrow geographical transition zones between locally dominant classes: these zones can be refined to delineate automatically classspecific boundaries. If spatial correlation in membership values is weak then broad zones of large values of CI occur all over the map. Simulation modelling and two case studies demonstrate that contiguity in geographical space is more important for successful mapping than attribute class compactness. The studies show that soil information systems must take the spatial aspects of soil variation into account; further improvements in identifying and mapping significant soil groupings should be possible using numerical models of soil processes together with the methods presented here.},

  abstract = {Previous attempts to devise automated methods of landscape classiÿcation have been frustrated by computational issues related to the size of the data set and the fact that most automated classiÿcation methods create discrete classes while ‘natural’ interpreted landscape units often have overlapping property sets. Methods of fuzzy k-means have been used by other workers to overcome the problem of class overlap but their usefulness may be reduced when data sets are large and when the data include artefacts introduced by the derivation of landform attributes from gridded digital elevation models. This paper presents ways to overcome these limitations using spatial sampling methods, statistical modelling of the derived stream topology, and fuzzy k-means using the Distance metric. Using data from Alberta, Canada, and the French pre-Alps it is shown how these methods may easily create meaningful, spatially coherent landform classes from high resolution gridded DEMs. c 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Nowadays, translating information about hydrologic and soil properties and processes across scales has emerged as a major theme in soil science and hydrology, and suitable theories for upscaling or downscaling hydrologic and soil information are being looked forward. The recognition of low-order catchments as self-organized systems suggests the existence of a great amount of links at different scales between their elements. The objective of this work was to research in areas of homogeneous bedrock material, the relationship between the hierarchical structure of the drainage networks at hillslope scale and the heterogeneity of the particle-size distribution at pedon scale. One of the most innovative elements in this work is the choice of the parameters to quantify the organization level of the studied features. The fractal dimension has been selected to measure the hierarchical structure of the drainage networks, while the Balanced Entropy Index (BEI) has been the chosen parameter to quantify the heterogeneity of the particle-size distribution from textural data. These parameters have made it possible to establish quantifiable relationships between two features attached to different steps in the scale range. Results suggest that the bedrock lithology of the landscape constrains the architecture of the drainage networks developed on it and the particle soil distribution resulting in the fragmentation processes.},

  abstract = {Geologists know that drainage networks can exhibit different drainage patterns depending on the hydrogeological properties of the underlying materials. Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies and the increasing availability and resolution of digital elevation data have greatly facilitated the delineation, quantification, and study of drainage networks. This study investigates the possibility of inferring geological information of the underlying material from fractal and linear parameters describing drainage networks automatically extracted from 5-mresolution LiDAR digital terrain model (DTM) data. According to the lithological information (scale 1:25,000), the study area is comprised of 30 homogeneous bedrock lithologies, the lithological map units (LMUs). These are mostly igneous and metamorphic rocks, but also include some sedimentary rocks. A statistical classification model of the LMUs by rock type has been proposed based on both the fractal dimension and drainage density of the overlying drainage networks. The classification model has been built using 16 LMUs, and it has correctly classified 13 of the 14 LMUs used for its validation. Results for the study area show that LMUs, with areas ranging from 177.83 ± 0.01 to 3.16 ± 0.01 km2, can be successfully classified by rock type using the fractal dimension and the drainage density of the drainage networks derived from medium resolution LiDAR DTM data with different flow support areas. These results imply that the information included in a 5-m-resolution LiDAR DTM and the appropriate techniques employed to manage it are the only inputs required to identify the underlying geological materials.},

  abstract = {Parent material is a soil forming factor which, specially in temperate climates, influences soil hydraulic properties. As direct measurements of the soil hydraulic properties are laborious, time-consuming and expensive, this work explores the influence of geological material on soil hydraulic properties using the Balanced Entropy Index (BEI) as a particle size distribution descriptor which was shown to be useful in the estimation of soil water retention properties. The studied geological materials correspond to the phyllites, quartz-phyllites, metagreywackes, quartzites, schists and granites in the Northern part of Portugal. The source of information used to carry out this study was the soil map of the studied region, scale 1/25,000. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests, followed by multiple comparisons between pairs of group medians using Bonferroni significant differences (BSD), were applied to determine if soil texture heterogeneity, measured using the BEI, significantly varied between the lithological groups under study. Results clearly show how the type of rock controls the BEI of the overlying soils in the studied area. Further implications of this result are discussed in the text.},

This work aims to quantify at different scales hydropedological properties of viticultural regions with different geological, climatic and cultural characteristics, and it also aims to explore the relationships between these hydropedological properties and the vineyard characteristics within the studied regions. The structure of drainage networks at landscape scale and the heterogeneity of the soil particle size distribution are the hydropedological properties considered for the purpose of this study. The three winegrowing regions are the Região Demarcada do Douro, in Portugal, and the D.O. Arribes and D.O. Campo de Borja, in Spain, involving a total area of 4,144 km2. The datasets for this work are the soil maps of the three regions scale 1/25,000, the digital terrain model, and the spatial database with the characteristics of the vineyards within the study area. Qualitative relationships have been established between landscape attributes, vineyard characteristics and physical soil properties. Results show that quantifying hydropedological properties using complexity measures provides innovative information of terroirs that could have multiple applications in terroir zoning studies.},

  abstract = {Fine-resolution soil maps constitute important data for many different environmental studies. Digital soil mapping techniques represent a cost-effective method to obtain detailed information about soil types and soil properties over large areas. The main objective of the study was to extend predictions from 1:25,000 legacy soil surveys (including WRB soil groups, soil depth and soil texture classes) to the larger area of Cyprus. A multiple-trees classification technique, namely Random Forest (RF), was applied. Specific objectives were: (i) to analyze the role and importance of a large data set of environmental predictors, (ii) to investigate the effect of the number of training points, forest size (ntree), the numbers of predictors sampled per node (mtry) and tree size (nodesize) in RF; (iii) to compare RF-derived maps with maps derived with a multinomial logistic regression model, in terms of validation error (test set and independent profiles) and map uncertainty, using the confusion index and a newly developed reliability index. The optimized RF model was run using half of the input points available (over a million) and with ntree equal to 350. The mtry parameter was set to 5 (close to half the number of the environmental variables used) for both soil series and soil properties. The nodesize calibration showed no relevant performance increase and was kept at its default value (1). In terms of environmental variables, the model used 10 predictors, covering all the soil formation factors considered in the scorpan formula, to derive the three maps. Soil properties, derived from geochemistry data, showed a high importance in deriving soil groups, depths and texture. Random Forest constructed a better predictive model than multinomial logistic regression, showing comparable predictive uncertainty but much lower validation error. The RF-derived maps show very low out of bag (OOB) errors (around 10\% for both soil groups and soil properties) but relatively high validation error from independent profiles (45\% for soil depth, 51\% for soil texture). The resulting reliability index was low in the main mountainous area of Cyprus, where predictions were extrapolations as indicated by the multivariate environmental similarity surface, but medium to high in the main agricultural areas of the country.},

These data streams pose a challenge for ecologists because traditional approaches to quality assurance and quality control are no longer practical when confronted with the size of these data sets and the demands of real-time processing. Automated methods for rapidly identifying and (ideally) correcting problematic data are essential. However, advances in sensor hardware have outpaced those in software, creating a need for tools to implement automated quality assurance and quality control procedures, produce graphical and statistical summaries for review, and track the provenance of the data. Use of automated tools would enhance data integrity and reliability and would reduce delays in releasing data products. Development of community-wide standards for quality assurance and quality control would instill confidence in sensor data and would improve interoperability across environmental sensor networks.},

There are different techniques available for this purpose, whose performance should be tested for different types of landscapes. The aim of this study was to spatialize chemical attributes of the soil, comparing eight methods of prediction. Forty morphometric attributes, generated from a digital elevation model, were used as independent variables, in addition to geophysical data, images from the Landsat 8 satellite and the NDVI. All possible combinations between the satellite bands were calculated, generating 28 new variables. Combinations between the Th, U and K bands obtained from the geophysical data were also calculated, generating a further three variables. The final variables to be calculated were the distances between the four points of the edges of the basin (d1, d2, d3 and d4). The dependent variables for the model were Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Si, Ti, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, V, Zn, Zr, S and Cl. A total of 200 soil samples were used, which were collected from 100 points at two depths (0-10 and 10-30 cm); the total elements were determined using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer. The Random Forest algorithm proved to be superior to the others in predicting the chemical attributes of the soil at both depths, and is suitable for predicting soil attributes in the study region. Spatial variables are essential, and should be considered when modelling chemical elements in the soil. Using the methods under test, it is possible to predict elements with R² values ranging from 0.32 to 0.62.},

The Rand index is a traditional criterion for assessment and comparison of different results provided by classifiers and clustering algorithms. It is able to measure the quality of different hard partitions of a data set from a classification perspective, including partitions with different numbers of classes or clusters. The original Rand index is extended here by making it able to evaluate a fuzzy partition of a data set – provided by a fuzzy clustering algorithm or a classifier with fuzzy-like outputs –against a reference hard partition that encodes the actual (known) data classes. A theoretical formulation based on formal concepts from the fuzzy set theory is derived and used as a basis for the mathematical interpretation of the Fuzzy Rand Index proposed. The fuzzy counterparts of other (five) related indexes, namely, the Adjusted Rand Index of Hubert and Arabie, the Jaccard coefficient, the Minkowski measure, the Fowlkes–Mallows Index, and the C statistics, are also derived from this formulation.},

  abstract = {Logistic models were developed to spatially predict the probability of drainage classes in a humid tropical area (58 900 ha) using sampled terrain attributes from a digital elevation model, and vegetation indices from a LANDSAT-5 Thematic Mapper image. Soil drainage classes were assigned on the basis of the local water table regime depth, determined by soil morphological indicators, to 295 pseudorandomly selected soil auger hole observations (calibration data set) and 72 soil pedon observations (validation data set). Six drainage classes were identified: excessively (D1), well (D2), moderately well (D3), imperfectly (D4), poorly (D5), and very poorly (D6). A nested dichotomous modeling strategy of progressively separating the six drainage classes was adopted, and resulted in five multivariate logistic models. The best performing model, predicting the probability of nonhydric (D1D2) soils versus hydric (D3D4D5D6) soils had a concordance of 99\%, and the worst performing model, predicting the probability of imperfectly (D4) drained soils versus moderately well (D3) drained soils had a concordance of 65\%. The most important spatial determinants were: elevation, slope, distance-to-the-river channel (DC), and vegetation indices. The logistic models were combined in a geographic information system (GIS) to derive soil drainage class maps using the gridded data sets of the significant variables. The results showed that digital elevation models and vegetation indices from LANDSAT-5 Thematic Mapper provide complementary information for developing statistical models to spatially predict and map soil drainage classes.},

Terron is a whole entity integrating soil properties (pedon) with topographic soil-forming factors (represented here by landform attributes)—which can be assimilated to terroir. For terron mapping, landform is not only an interpolation support as it is in existing models, but also a taxonomic variable. Data from French databases are used to illustrate this concept. Terron mapping consists of four stages. First is the classification of n area-representative soil types with landform attributes by fuzzy k-means with extragrades into n terron classes. Second is the establishment of terronlandform rules using a multi-linear regression. Third is the interpolation of the terron-landform rules using regression-kriging. Fourth is validation with a second sample dataset. The results are compared with a soil map created with a regression-kriging model.},

  abstract = {Legacy soil data form an important resource for digital soil mapping and are essential for calibration of models for predicting soil properties from environmental variables. Such data arise from traditional soil survey. Methods of soil survey are generally empirical and based on the mental development of the surveyor, correlating soil with underlying geology, landforms, vegetation and air-photo interpretation. There are no statistical criteria for traditional soil sampling, and this may lead to biases in the areas being sampled. The challenge is to test the use of legacy data for largearea mapping (e.g. national or continental extents) in order to limit the funds of field survey for large-area mapping. The problem is then to assess the reliability and quality of the legacy soil databases that have been mainly populated by traditional soil survey, and if there is a possibility of additional funding for sampling, to determine where new sampling units should be located. This additional sampling can be used to improve and validate the prediction model.},

The research was conducted in two stages. The first stage focused on basic-spectral landform classifications where both pixel- and object-based image analyses were tested with five classification algorithms: Mahalanobis Distance (MD), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT). The results obtained indicate that object-based analyses clearly outperform pixel-based classifications, with an increase in accuracy of up to 35\%. The second stage focused on advanced object-based derived variables with topographic ancillary data classifications. The combinations of variables were tested in order to obtain the most accurate map of landforms based on the most successful classifiers identified in the previous stage (ML, SVM and DT). The results indicate that DT is the most accurate classifier, exhibiting the highest overall accuracies with values greater than 72\% in both the winter and summer images. Future work could combine both, the most appropriate methodologies and combinations of variables obtained in this study, with physico-chemical variables sampled to improve the classification of landforms and even of types of soil.},

A probabilistic approach, based on multivariate geostatistics was used to model the spatial variation of soil salinization risk at the landscape scale and to delineate the areas at high risk. The study site is a citrus growing area in south-eastern Sardinia (Italy). Electrical conductivity (ECe), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), pH and ‘total clay + fine silt content’ (FIN), were measured in the topsoil (0–40 cm). The method requires indicator coding, which transforms measured data values into a binary variable according to critical thresholds. These latter were set to: 4 dS m-1 for ECe, 10\% for ESP, 8 for pH, and 40\% for ‘total clay + fine silt content’. To determine the probability of exceeding these critical values, multi-collocated indicator cokriging was used. Factorial kriging was also applied to identify one regionalized factor that summarizes the effects of the selected variables on soil salinization. Maps of each soil indicator and regionalized factor were produced to show the areas at risk of salinization. The results are valuable for planning the management of salinity.},

As a consequence, multiple soil maps are sometimes available for a particular area. Rather than selecting the best map, model ensemble offers a way to capitalize on existing soil information, and to improve the map accuracy. In this study we ensemble four topsoil texture maps of France with different resolution made by different organizations at the national, European, and global scale. We investigated two methods of model ensemble: the Granger-Ramanathan (GR) and Variance-Weighted (VW) methods. Ensemble methods based on area stratification were also tested to take into account local soil information. We also assessed the impact of the number of calibration points on the evaluation indicators. Both ensemble methods improved the accuracy of the map compared to the best of the primary maps, while the GR method outperformed the VW method. We found that the different stratification strategies did not improve the accuracy significantly when compared to the global methods. Finally, we showed that a relatively low number of calibration points is required in the merging process if the sampling is well designed. This study demonstrates that digital soil mapping products at various scales from various data sources can be combined with the ensemble method taking advantage of all existing efforts and taking care of harmonization issues.},

  abstract = {Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are fundamental in assessing soil variability and are regularly used in Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) as a scale benchmark for all the other environmental covariates. They are conventionally used at their original grid resolution with a conventional 3 × 3 window size for the computation of the derived terrain attributes. The choice of scale frames the analysis and shapes the end result suggesting that better attention and quantitative knowledge of scale may improve predictive performance. Previous studies have shown the influence of pixel size but have not investigated in detail the interacting effect between window and pixel sizes. The aim of this study was to examine the scale dependency of soil classification performance at the landscape scale using two machine-learning techniques commonly applied in DSM: artificial neural networks and random forest. These were applied in three different areas in terms of their geomorphology and soil type located in Ireland. A series of DEMs representing different scales were created from the original 20 m DEM by smoothing and re-sampling it with different window and pixel sizes for a total of 143 combinations: the original, 10 smoothed but not re-sampled, 12 re-sampled and not smoothed, and 120 smoothed and re-sampled. These were used to generate 11 terrain parameters from which 4 points per km2 were randomly extracted and used to predict soil classes. The overall prediction accuracy in the three study areas varied between 35\% and 60\%. Pixel size was found significant in all areas, the interaction between window and pixel sizes significant in morphologically rough areas and window size was significant only in flat homogeneous areas at coarser resolutions (above 140 m in this study). In general, predictive performance was best at very fine and very coarse scales in morphologically varied areas, coarse scales in flat homogenous areas and relatively scale invariant in mixed areas. We conclude by examining whether this empirical approach is appropriate to compare scale combinations to obtain a better prediction accuracy of DSM techniques.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral images were acquired along the Front Range Urban Corridor in Colorado to determine the feasibility of identification and mapping of expansive clay soils with two, high-SNR imaging spectrometers. Swelling soils are a major geologic hazard, and cause extensive damage world-wide every year. The cost of postconstruction mitigation and standard engineering soil tests for creation of regional maps are immense. Smectite is the clay mineral group that has the greatest swelling potential and is responsible for most of the severe swelling soil damage observed in Colorado. Data sets were acquired from 1997 to 1999 with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap). Using a matched filtering algorithm, maps of exposed clay material were produced, despite a strong vegetation cover. Among those exposures, spectral discrimination and identification of variable clay mineralogy such as smectite, smectite/illite, and kaolinite, in decreasing order of swelling potential hazard, was possible. The comparison of the results from the two sensors showed that higher spatial resolution provided purer image endmembers in more heterogeneous sites, but did not exhibit more endmembers and did not identify new natural outcrops that a lower spatial resolution data set would miss in a homogeneous terrain. However, an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the instrument by pixel summation made possible the identification of low reflectance exposures. This work demonstrates that, using recent instruments and well-established methodologies, imaging spectrometry can be of practical help for the detection and mapping of expansive clays.},

  abstract = {A new complete map of soil series probabilities has been produced for the contiguous United States at a 30 m spatial resolution. This innovative database, named POLARIS, is constructed using available high-resolution geospatial environmental data and a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm (DSMART-HPC) to remap the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. This 9 billion grid cell database is possible using available high performance computing resources. POLARIS provides a spatially continuous, internally consistent, quantitative prediction of soil series. It offers potential solutions to the primary weaknesses in SSURGO: 1) unmapped areas are gap-filled using survey data from the surrounding regions, 2) the artificial discontinuities at political boundaries are removed, and 3) the use of high resolution environmental covariate data leads to a spatial disaggregation of the coarse polygons. The geospatial environmental covariates that have the largest role in assembling POLARIS over the contiguous United States (CONUS) are fine-scale (30 m) elevation data and coarse-scale (\textasciitilde 2 km) estimates of the geographic distribution of uranium, thorium, and potassium. A preliminary validation of POLARIS using the NRCS National Soil Information System (NASIS) database shows variable performance over CONUS. In general, the best performance is obtained at grid cells where DSMART-HPC is most able to reduce the chance of misclassification. The important role of environmental covariates in limiting prediction uncertainty suggests including additional covariates is pivotal to improving POLARIS' accuracy. This database has the potential to improve the modeling of biogeochemical, water, and energy cycles in environmental models; enhance availability of data for precision agriculture; and assist hydrologic monitoring and forecasting to ensure food and water security.},

  abstract = {A fast and convenient soil analytical technique is needed for soil quality assessment and precision soil management. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict diverse soil properties. Near-infrared reflectance spectra, obtained from a Perstrop NIR Systems 6500 scanning monochromator (Foss NIRSystems, Silver Spring, MD), and 33 chemical, physical, and biochemical properties were studied for 802 soil samples collected from four Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs). Calibrations were based on principal component regression (PCR) using the first derivatives of optical density [log(1/R)] for the 1300- to 2500-nm spectral range. Total C, total N, moisture, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), 1.5 MPa water, basal respiration rate, sand, silt, and Mehlich III extractable Ca were successfully predicted by NIRS (r
2 {$>$} 0.80). Some Mehlich III extractable metals (Fe, K, Mg, Mn) and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, and K), sum of exchangeable bases, exchangeable acidity, clay, potentially mineralizable N, total respiration rate, biomass C, and pH were also estimated by NIRS but with less accuracy (r
2 = 0.80∼0.50). The predicted results for aggregation (wt\% {$>$} 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 mm, and macroaggregation) were not reliable (r
2 = 0.46∼0.60). Mehlich III extractable Cu, P, and Zn, and exchangeable Na could not be predicted using the NIRS–PCR technique (r
2 {$<$} 0.50). The results indicate that NIRS can be used as a rapid analytical technique to simultaneously estimate several soil properties with acceptable accuracy in a very short time.},

  abstract = {One of the most important scientific challenges of digital soil mapping is to develop generic models that may allow the soils to be predicted over large areas. Our objective here is to quantify the relationships between the soils and their ‘‘environment’’ to further our understanding of the rules of soil distribution. The study was conducted in the Armorican Massif (30,000 km2), a metamorphic area of western France where soils formed under conditions of poor drainage due to water accumulation within slopes and/or low infiltration. Field investigations on a 2-ha site and detailed soil map (1:25,000) analysis, were used to compare quantitative relationships between hydromorphic soils and soil-forming factors of topography, climate and geology. Soil surveys at both scales revealed a continuous succession downslope–upslope of soils with fluvic properties, soils with glossic and/or albic features, soils with other redoximorphic features (RFs) and soils without RF. These soils are distributed along slopes in the same order with only variations in their relative extent. At a single site, the soil hydromorphy significantly correlated with terrain attributes extracted from the surface topography of elevation above the stream bank, ES (r2 ¼ 0.79) and the compound topographic index, CTI (r2 ¼ 0.62). Greater correlations were obtained by using attributes from the topography of the saprolite upper boundary, that possibly betterexplained water movement within hillslopes. The total variance of regional data accounted for by the first two principal components (PCs) was 74\%. The first PC explained 52\% of the variance and exhibited a pattern associated with the presence or absence of RFs in soils. Environmental factors having the highest (absolute) values for this factor are not only mean slope gradient but also geologic substrate, net rainfall (NR) and uplift ratio (UR). These results revealed that other factors than topography have to be considered to account for the range of processes leading to soil hydromorphy over a region. Because these processes act at different spatial scales, multiscale approaches are required not only to detect the patterns of soil distribution but also to develop generic and high-resolution prediction models for the characterisation of large areas.},

  abstract = {Conventional soil maps contain valuable knowledge on soil–environment relationships. Such knowledge can be extracted for use when updating conventional soil maps with improved environmental data. Existing methods take all polygons of the same map unit on a map as a whole to extract the soil–environment relationship. Such approach ignores the difference in the environmental conditions represented by individual soil polygons of the same map unit. This paper proposes a method of mining soil–environment relationships from individual soil polygons to update conventional soil maps. The proposed method consists of three major steps. Firstly, the soil–environment relationships represented by each individual polygon on a conventional soil map are extracted in the form of frequency distribution curves for the involved environmental covariates. Secondly, for each environmental covariate, these frequency distribution curves from individual polygons of the same soil map unit are synthesized to form the overall soil–environment relationship for that soil map unit across the mapped area. And lastly, the extracted soil–environment relationships are applied to updating the conventional soil map with new, improved environmental data by adopting a soil land inference model (SoLIM) framework. This study applied the proposed method to updating a conventional soil map of the Raffelson watershed in La Crosse County, Wisconsin, United States. The result from the proposed method was compared with that from the previous method of taking all polygons within the same soil map unit on a map as a whole. Evaluation results with independent soil samples showed that the proposed method exhibited better performance and produced higher accuracy.},

The maximum laser pulse frequency of modern LIDAR system has reached more than 250 kHz. In addition to such high reputation rate, multiple surveys over same area achieve 0.3 to 0.5 meters per point data resolution. High resolution three dimensional topographic data potentially holds useful information which can not be expressed by ordinal visualization method. In this study we propose Red Relief Image Map (RRIM). This new visualization method is based on multi-layered topographic information computed from gridded three dimensional data (DEM). RRIM can visualize the topographic slope, concavities and convexities at the same time. RRIM does not require the any specialty of geomatics nor mapping information to understand detail of topographic information to the image audience. The application of RRIM is not only LiDAR data but also wide variety three dimensional data such as SRTM, GTOPO30 and ETOPO2.},

Random Uniform Forests are designed for classification, regression and unsupervised learning. They are an ensemble model that builds many unpruned and randomized binary decision trees. Unlike Random Forests, they use random cut-points to grow each tree. Unlike Extremely randomized trees, they use bootstrap and subsampling, since Out-of-bag (OOB) modeling plays a key role. Unlike both algorithms, for each node, sampling with replacement is done to select features. The main purposes of the algorithm are to get low correlated trees, to allow a deep analysis of variable importance and to be natively incremental. Random uniform decision trees are the core of the model. We provide an R package (randomUniformForest) that implements almost all functions of the algorithm, including Breiman’s bounds and, in this overview, we present an overview of theoretical arguments and fully comprehensive examples with R code.},

  abstract = {We review and give a practical example of Latin hypercube sampling in soil science using an approach we call flexible Latin hypercube sampling. Recent studies of soil properties in large and remote regions have highlighted problems with the conventional Latin hypercube sampling approach. It is often impractical to travel far from tracks and roads to collect samples, and survey planning should recognise this fact. Another problem is how to handle target sites that, for whatever reason, are impractical to sample – should one just move on to the next target or choose something in the locality that is accessible? Working within a Latin hypercube that spans the covariate space, selecting an alternative site is hard to do optimally. We propose flexible Latin hypercube sampling as a means of avoiding these problems. Flexible Latin hypercube sampling involves simulated annealing for optimally selecting accessible sites from a region. The sampling protocol also produces an ordered list of alternative sites close to the primary target site, should the primary target site prove inaccessible. We highlight the use of this design through a broad-scale sampling exercise in the Burdekin catchment of north Queensland, Australia. We highlight the robustness of our design through a simulation study where up to 50\% of target sites may be inaccessible.},

Our ability to create meaningful geographical indications (GIs) is limited by our inability to establish terroirs on a large spatial extent ({$>$}100 km 2). We performed an investigation to build on previous efforts to quanti tatively establish terroirs for Semillon grapes grown in Australia’s Lower Hunter Valley (Area \textasciitilde 200 km2). We mapped 10 soil variables, six terrain variables and three climate variables across the entire region to a resolution of 25 m. We clustered these variables, using fuzzy-k-means, to create a single ‘Terron map’ that parsimoniously divided the Lower Hunter Valley into six distinct environments (Terrons). The addition of climate variables and new soil data enabled an improvement on the previously created Lower Hunter Valley Terron map. Moreover, preliminary analysis indicated substantial variation in Semillon grape juice characteristics across the Lower Hunter Valley. We concluded the region covered by the ‘Hunter Valley’ Geographical Indication is more than two orders of magnitude too large to meaningfully reflect terroir. The methodologies discussed in this report could be reapplied to establish terroir and thus GIs for other perennial crops.},

We developed and tested a methodology that incorporates geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing and modelling to predict and map soil distribution in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. Based on conceptual models in which unique soils are the products of unique sets of soil-forming factors, topographic data derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and Landsat 5 spectral data were selected to represent soil-forming factors. These digital data were analysed using commercially available GIS and image processing software. Unsupervised, supervised and simple knowledge-based classifications were used in the preliminary stage to develop visual representations of soil-landscape patterns and to plan for field data collection. As more was learned about the survey area from data collection, a knowledge-based decision-tree classification model was built and refined. The resulting maps were evaluated qualitatively by local experts and quantitatively using accuracy assessment, and showed good agreement between predicted and observed map units. Continued technological advancements in spatial data and improved GIS and modelling expertise of soil scientists should increase the accuracy and efficiency of the soil survey process.},

In the last five years, these two sister disciplines have developed technology and methods that challenge the current aeronautical regulatory framework and their own traditional acquisition and processing methods. Navety and ingenuity have combined off-the-shelf, low-cost equipment with sophisticated computer vision, robotics and geomatic engineering. The results are cm-level resolution and accuracy products that can be generated even with cameras costing a few-hundred euros.

  abstract = {The System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) is an open source geographic information system (GIS), mainly licensed under the GNU General Public License. Since its first release in 2004, SAGA has rapidly developed from a specialized tool for digital terrain analysis to a comprehensive and globally established GIS platform for scientific analysis and modeling. SAGA is coded in C + + in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system’s architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.},

\par
"More recently, Bivand (2014) discussed FOSS for geocomputation. The System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) (http: //sagagis.org), the subject of this paper, is one of the recognized developments in this field." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BEILI7R7?page=1}{Conrad et al 2015:1991})

"SAGA has been designed for an easy and effective implementation of spatial algorithms and hence serves as a framework for the development and implementation of geoscientific methods and models (Conrad, 2007" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BEILI7R7?page=1}{Conrad et al 2015:1991})
\par
"The idea for the development of SAGA evolved in the late 1990s during the work on several research and development projects at the Dept. for Physical Geography, Göttingen, carried out on behalf of federal and state environmental authorities." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BEILI7R7?page=1}{Conrad et al 2015:1991})
\par
"Due to the heterogeneity of the applied operating systems and tools in the working group, a cross operating system platform with integrated support for geodata analysis seemed necessary for further development and implementation of geoscientific methods." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BEILI7R7?page=2}{Conrad et al 2015:1992})
\par
"Furthermore, the integration of such implementations into more complex work flows for certain applications and the immediate accessibility in a user friendly way was one major concern." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BEILI7R7?page=3}{Conrad et al 2015:1993})
\par
"Thus, instead of creating one monolithic program, we designed a modular system with an application programming interface (API) at its base, method implementations, in the following referred to as tools, organized in separate program or tool libraries, and a graphical user interface Visualization (17) ig. 5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BEILI7R7?page=3}{Conrad et al 2015:1993})

\par
"Within this group, a toolset interfacing the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) should be highlighted (http://www.gdal.org) (Bivand, 2014). The GDAL itself provides drivers for more than 200 different raster and vector formats, and therefore the SAGA API's data manager automatically loads unknown file formats through the GDAL by default."

\par
"in topographically structured terrain and especially in high mountain environments, where the often low density and non-representative distribution of met stations lead to unsatisfying interpolation results, statistical methods utilizing explanatory fields (e.g., DEM elevation and its firstand second-order partial derivatives) as statistical predictors are distinctly preferred in climate spatialization."

  abstract = {Image segmentation is a process by which an image is partitioned into regions with similar features. Many approaches have been proposed for color image segmentation, but Fuzzy C-Means has been widely used, because it has a good performance in a large class of images. However, it is not adequate for noisy images and it also takes more time for execution as compared to other method as K-means. For this reason, several methods have been proposed to improve these weaknesses. Method like Possibilistic C-Means, Fuzzy Possibilistic C-Means, Robust Fuzzy Possibilistic C-Means and Fuzzy C-Means with Gustafson-Kessel algorithm. In this paper we perform a comparison of these clustering algorithms applied to feature extraction on vineyard images. Segmented images are evaluated using several quality parameters such as the rate of correctly classified area and runtime.},

However, many geostatistical methods require the assumption that our observed data are a realization of a random function which is intrinsically stationarity. Under stationarity, observations of a single realization of the random function at different positions can be treated as a form of replication. There are various ways in which a random function may breach the assumption of intrinsic stationarity and numerous geostatistical techniques have been developed that are able to cope with some forms of non-stationarity. What is currently needed is a set of diagnostic tools capable of detecting and identifying when data cannot plausibly be treated as a realization of a process which is stationary in the variance.},

  abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEM) used in digital soil mapping (DSM) are commonly selected based on measures and indicators (quality criteria) that are thought to reflect how well a given DEM represents the terrain surface. The hypothesis is that the more accurate a DEM, the more accurate will be the DSM predictions. The objective of this study was to assess different criteria to identify the DEM that delivers the most accurate DSM predictions. A set of 10 criteria were used to evaluate the quality of nine DEMs constructed with different data sources, processing routines and three resolutions (5, 20, and 30 m). Multinomial logistic regression models were calibrated using 157 soil observations and terrain attributes derived from each DEM. Soil class predictions were validated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Results showed that, for each resolution, the quality criteria are useful to identify the DEM that more accurately represents the terrain surface. However, for all three resolutions, the most accurate DEM did not produce the most accurate DSM predictions. With the 20-m resolution DEMs, DSM predictions were five percentage points less accurate when using the more accurate DEM. The 5-m resolution was the most accurate DEM overall and resulted in DSM predictions with 44\% accuracy; this value was equal to that obtained with two coarser resolution, lower accuracy DEMs. Thus, identifying the truly best DEM for DSM requires assessment of the accuracy of DSM predictions using some form of external validation, because not necessarily the most accurate DEM will produce the best DSM predictions.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work was to disaggregate the polygons of physiographic map units in order to individualize the soil classes in each one, representing them as simple soil map units and generating a more detailed soil map than the original one, making these data more useful for future reference. A physiographic map, on a 1:25,000 scale, of the Tarumãzinho watershed, located in the municipality of Águas Frias, in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, was used. For disaggregation, three geomorphometric parameters were applied: slope and landforms, both derived from the digital terrain model; and an elevation map. The boundaries of the physiographic units and the elevation, slope, and landform maps were subjected to cross tabulation to identify the existing combinations between the soil classes of each physiographic unit. Based on these combinations, rules were established to select typical areas of occurrence of each soil type in order to train a decision tree model to predict the occurrence of soil classes. The model was trained using the Weka software and was validated with a set of georeferenced soil profiles. Disaggregation enables the individualization and spatialization of soil classes and is useful in producing detailed soil maps.},

Chromosols (5.3\%) and Sodosols (1.6\%) are relatively minor soils in Tasmania, occurring predominantly in lower rainfall areas with {$<$}800 mm average annual rainfall. Parent material is a strong determinant of soil distribution in Tasmania but many Soil Orders occur on a wide range of parent materials. Brown suborders are predominant in several Soil Orders. A large part of Tasmania (2 658 000 ha) is mapped as being used for conservation, with one-third of this area being mapped as Organosols. The mean surface horizon soil carbon content (4.3\%) is relatively high, likely due to Tasmania’s relatively high annual rainfall and cool temperatures. Most Soil Orders have moderately acid surface horizons but soils on calcareous parent materials are neutral to strongly alkaline (Tenosols and Calcarosols). The dataset covers the mainland extent of Tasmania, as well as all large islands around Tasmania’s coastline including King, Flinders, Hunter, Three Hummock, Robbins, Cape Barren, Clarke, and Maria Islands.},

  abstract = {Network backbone extraction techniques reduce the size of networks while trying to preserve their key topological and spatial features. Various backbone extraction algorithms have been proposed in different scientific fields. Although of clear interest to transport geographers, backbone extraction techniques have been adopted unevenly and in an ad hoc fashion in transport geography research. In this paper we therefore present a conceptual and experimental comparison of backbone extraction techniques in a transport-geographical context, and explore the new insights each technique can offer to enhance our understanding of the Southeast Asian intercity air transport network (SAAN). We review six frequently-used methods, i.e. global weight thresholding method (GWTM), k-core decomposition method (KCDM), minimum spanning tree method (MSTM), primary linkage analysis method (PLAM), multiple linkage analysis method (MLAM), and the disparity filter algorithm method (DFAM), and elaborate their analytical essence by applying them to extract the backbone of the SAAN. The abstracted networks are compared in terms of their geographical and topological structures using the initial network as a benchmark. This comparison is then used to point out the different techniques' potential in light of different transport geography research applications.},

  abstract = {Of particular importance to the study of large-scale phenomena in physical geography is the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). While often viewed as only a problem in human geography (particularly demographic studies), the MAUP is an issue for all quantitative studies in geography of spatial phenomena (Openshaw and Taylor, 1979). Increasingly, remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are being used to assess the distribution of phenomena from a large scale. These phenomena are modelled using areal units that can take any shape or size resulting in complications with statistical analysis related to both the scale and method used to create the areal units. In this paper, we define the modifiable areal unit problem, present examples of when it is a problem in physical geography studies, and review some potential solutions to the problem. Our aim is to increase awareness of this complicated issue and to promote further discussion and interest in this topic.},

A digital elevation model of 25 meter grid resolution was used to derive fifteen terrain attributes. A digitized soil map of thirteen WRB soil groups at the scale of 1:25,000 was used to obtain the reference soil data for model building and validation. First, the relationships between the soil groups and the terrain attributes were modeled using multinomial logistic regression. Then, the probability that a given soil type is present at a given pixel was determined from the logit models in ARCGIS to continuously map each soil group's spatial distribution. Elevation, flow length, duration of daily direct solar radiation, slope, aspect and topographic wetness index were found to be the most significant terrain attributes correlating with the spatial distribution of the soil groups. The prediction showed higher mean probability values for each soil group in the areas actually covered by that soil group compared to other areas, indicating the reliability of the prediction. However, the prediction performed poorly for soil groups that are not greatly influenced by topography but by other factors such as human activities.},

The conventional geographic model used for soil-landscape description is not able to properly deal with these. Fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to a hillslope within a small drainage basin in southern Spain. Cluster validity evaluation was based on the coefficient of determination of regressing topsoil clay data on membership grades. The resulting clusters occupied spatially contiguous areas. We found a high degree of association with measured topsoil clay data Ž ra2 s 0.68. for three clusters and a weighting exponent of 2.1. Location of the clusters coincided with observable terrain characteristics. Therefore we concluded that the coefficient of determination of regressing soil sample data on membership grades efficiently supports deciding upon the optimum fuzzy c-partition. The study confirms that fuzzy c-means clustering of terrain attribute data enhances conventional soil-landscape modelling, as it allows representation of fuzziness inherent to soil-landscape units. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

In this paper a methodological framework is formulated that takes advantage of a GIS to interactively formalise soil-landscape knowledge using stepwise image interpretation and inductive learning of soil-landscape relationships. It examines topology to keep record of potential part of relationships between terrain objects denoting discontinuities in soil formation regimes. The relationships are used to visualise the pathway along which terrain objects have been derived. They can be applied in similar areas to facilitate image interpretation by restricting possible lower-level terrain objects. The framework may adopt different inductive methods to describe soil variation in relation to a terrain description. It is illustrated using stratification of soil texture data according to terrain object classes in a case study within the Guadalhorce basin in southern Spain. The degree of association between terrain object classes and particle size classes increased from 6\% to 38\% in three steps of image interpretation. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Soil mapping has been identified as key to environmental issues. The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km2. The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the ‘true’ but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5\% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68\%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92\% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantification, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others.},

"ollowing its introduction at the beginning of the twentieth century by Pearson (1901) and Hotelling (1933), principal components analysis (PCA) has been used in many different disciplines, including agriculture, biology, chemistry, climatology, demography, ecology, economics, genetics, geography, geology, meteorology, oceanography, and psychology" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=2}{Demšar et al 2013:107})

"Two properties that can make spatial data special and different from nonspatial data are spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=2}{Demšar et al 2013:107})
\par
"Spatial heterogeneity refers to the nonstationarity of geographic processes, meaning that processes can vary locally and are not necessarily the same at each spatial location." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=2}{Demšar et al 2013:107})

\par
"The presence of spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation invalidates two basic assumptions of many standard statistical analyses: that data are independently generated and identically distributed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=2}{Demšar et al 2013:107})

\par
"there often exists a smaller intrinsic dimensionality in the data set, where not all of the variables are needed to convey the information relevant to an understanding of the underlying process." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"Therefore, it is often of interest to reduce the dimensionality of the data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"Methods for dimensionality reduction attempt to capture the maximum information present in the original data, at the same time minimizing the error between the original data and the new lower dimensional representation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"PCA is one of the most popular dimensionality reduction methods. It is a linear method, meaning that the transformation between the original data and the new lower dimensional representation is a linear projection" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"Its main purpose is dimensionality reduction, but it can also be used to explore relationships between variables." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"Often it is used as a preprocessing method either for data orthogonalization and eliminating redundancy caused by variable correlation or for dimensionality reduction," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"before employing another statistical method, such as regression or clustering (Fodor 2002; Jolliffe 2002)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"As principal components (PCs) are orthogonal, regression and clustering methods can proceed with data independence assured." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"P is computed so that its columns are the directions of maximum variance in the data, with the first column (or PC1) representing the direction of maximum variance" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"These directions correspond to the eigenvectors of either the data covariance or correlation matrix," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"In many situations X can be approximated by a small number of PCs, k, where k {$<<$} r ≤ n, while still explaining most of the variance in the data; that is, where  only has a small number of large eigenvalues and many small ones." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"From this description it follows that each PC corresponds to the direction of one eigenvector and is a linear combination of the original variables." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})
\par
"Because PCs are ordered according to the size of their respective eigenvalues, starting with the largest, this means that the new space of the PCs is oriented so that the first few PCs are aligned with the directions of the largest variance in the data; that is," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=3}{Demšar et al 2013:108})

"If the measurement units of variables differ in size and type, then the scaleindependent correlation matrix should be used instead to standardize the original variables. This avoids a domination of variables with the largest measurement units in the first few PCs (Ma ́ckiewicz and Ratajczak 1993; Jolliffe 2002)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=4}{Demšar et al 2013:109})

"With respect to data set structure, PCA can be run in two ways: either in the so-called R-mode or Q-mode" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=4}{Demšar et al 2013:109})
\par
"In R-mode, the goal is to identify combinations of variables that explain the pattern of variation among the objects—this is the standard way of running PCA. Qmode PCA, which is sometimes referred to as inverted PCA, focuses on combinations of samples that explain variation among variables" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=4}{Demšar et al 2013:109})
\par
"In our context, PCA should be seen as a descriptive methodology rather than an inferential one, as it can produce valuable information regardless if the attributes are normally distributed or not. That is, it provides a view on the structure of data as they are within the sample, rather than attempting to infer characteristics of the entire population. This is the perspective that the majority of applications in this overview would take. Details on the inferential side of PCA can be found in Jolliffe (2002)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=4}{Demšar et al 2013:109})
\par
"When there are outliers in the sample data, basic statistical methods often produce unreliable results, as the presence of outliers violates basic assumptions of the methods. This is usually prevented by using a robust version of the same method." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=4}{Demšar et al 2013:109})
\par
"PCA in a basic form is not very robust to outlying observations (i.e., its covariance estimates are nonrobust) and, as such, is not ideally suited to their detection." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=4}{Demšar et al 2013:109})
\par
"Here PCA can be made robust to outliers by using (1) some robust covariance estimator (such as a reweighted minimum covariance determinant [MCD];" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=4}{Demšar et al 2013:109})

"each sample of a number of chemical elements are measured (e.g., Filzmoser, Hron, and Reiman 2009)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"This constraint means that the attribute values of such data occur in a space limited by a simplex and are therefore closed in space, which affects the structure of the correlations. A standard multivariate method such as PCA is therefore not applicable to such data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"compositional data analysis (Aitchison 1982; Aitchison and Egozcue 2005), which replaces variables with logarithmic ratios of variables (or some related transformation). This removes the constraint of the simplex and transforms the variables into an unconstrained multivariate space and consequently allows a standard statistical method to be applied." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"Specifically, compositional PCA (Aitchison 1983) calculates PCs of log ratio transformations of the raw data" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"Compositional PCA is able to correctly pick up this curvature, whereas a standard PCA, which only produces linear combinations of variables, is powerless (Jolliffe 2002)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"However, the log ratio transformation in compositional PCA further complicates the already difficult interpretation of PCs (Aitchison and Egozcue 2005)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"PCs are therefore not always easy to interpret." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"One attempt to solve this problem is to rotate the PCs post-analysis into new dimensions that might have an easier-to-interpret connection with the original variables." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"This is commonly done using varimax, covarimax, or similar rotations that originate in factor analysis (FA) and were designed to maximize the variance of the factors (Kaiser 1958)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"As described earlier, PCA can be defined as a technique that identifies a set of linear combinations of original variables with no preassumed models: PCs are defined simply as directions of largest variance." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"FA, on the other hand, attempts to achieve dimensionality reduction by assuming the existence of k latent variables or factors (where k {$<<$} n and n is the number of variables), such that each original variable is a linear combination of factors." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"There is no explicit model in the classic derivation of PCA whose results are dependent on data only (although it is possible to consider model-based PCA," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"Standard PCA finds a data-defined linear transformation from an n-dimensional space to another n-dimensional space and no additional parameters have to be specified." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"FA provides us with a model of the lower dimensional space, whereas PCA produces a unique data-driven projection." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=5}{Demšar et al 2013:110})
\par
"In standard PCA, the data are assumed to be such a matrix plus an independent Gaussian error term for each element—but the model can be modified to represent a number of alternative situations" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})
\par
"One such example is that of a spatial PCA, where the statistical distribution of the error terms reflects the spatial structure of the observations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})
\par
"This approach, in which the data might be thought of as a linear combination of a number of unobserved variables (PCs) plus a random error," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})
\par
"is sometimes referred to as latent models or latent variable models (see subsection on regionalized PCA)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})
\par
"Another modification can be used to reflect a hierarchical structure in the data. This means that the data set consists of individual data records for which factors are calculated at different levels of aggregation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})
\par
"In turn, this implies that the models can be thought of as having components at different levels of the hierarchy." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})
\par
"In this model-based approach, Bayesian estimation of the loadings can also be used and through techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, a very wide portfolio of models and modifications to existing models can be considered" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})

"One of the most common uses of PCA on spatial data is in studies where spatial data consist of spatial objects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})
\par
"These are typically either irregularly spaced points (e.g., sampling sites of environmental measurements) or areas (e.g., watersheds or administrative districts). Variables are measurements of several different properties (characteristics) at each point or area location" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})
\par
"In these studies, PCA is run on the entire data set, statistical software is (commonly) used for processing rather than a geographical information system (GIS), and geographical effects do not play any role in the PCA itself. Results give a global summary of the data and are presented nonspatially using tables and statistical summaries" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})

"Observe that it is possible to map the PC scores (i.e., the transformed data values after applying PCA) for each PC, as they correspond to each vector of observations at each spatial location of the data set. Regionalization studies in the social sciences provide numerous examples of this practice" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=6}{Demšar et al 2013:111})

\par
"As with the analogous methods in the previous section, geographical effects are not accounted for in the calculation of the PCs, as the analysis is run strictly on attribute space only. It should be noted that, mathematically, this methodology is a variation of spatial objects PCA from the previous section; the only difference is that in this case "spatial objects" correspond to regular grid cells or locations of their centers."

"The three subspaces of the space-time data set are geographic space, temporal space, and attribute space." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=11}{Demšar et al 2013:116})
\par
"Because each PC/EOF is a linear combination (i.e., a weighted sum) of all locations, a map can be produced for each PC/EOF" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=11}{Demšar et al 2013:116})
\par
"Here the calculated weights of the respective PC/EOF at each sampling location are spatially interpolated to form a contour map, which is then inspected for spatial patterns" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=11}{Demšar et al 2013:116})
\par
"Furthermore, the PCs/EOFs are often rotated postanalysis (as in FA) to facilitate the interpretation of the resulting component maps." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=11}{Demšar et al 2013:116})
\par
"It is important to note the difference in the information represented by this approach compared to raster data PCA and the difference in their spatial visualizations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=11}{Demšar et al 2013:116})
\par
"Raster PC maps show values (scores) of PCs (latent variables) at each location (represented as a grid cell), as each location is considered as a data element in the spatial data set. This is in contrast to atmospheric science PC/EOF maps, which show PC loadings at each location (because each location is considered to be a variable and not a data element)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=11}{Demšar et al 2013:116})
\par
"Again, this use of PCA often precedes the use of some clustering or classification algorithm; for example, circulation pattern classification, classification of weather types, climate regionalization," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=11}{Demšar et al 2013:116})
\par
"In this section, we describe three truly spatial PCA techniques that are specifically designed for, or account for, spatial effects in spatial data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"First, we look at two closely related PCA techniques that are adapted locally in attribute and in geographical space, respectively." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"These techniques adopt a nonparametric, kernel-based approach and are termed locally weighted PCA (LWPCA) and geographically weighted PCA (GWPCA)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"Second, we describe a PCA technique that directly accounts for spatial autocorrelation in the data via Moran's I statistic and, in doing so, has links to related models concerning eigenfunction spatial filtering. Third, we look at the use of PCA for exploring different structures of the variogram, a measure of spatial autocorrelation commonly used in geostatistics," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"Finally, as a caveat to this section, we discuss the ambiguities that are often found in the literature when labeling a PCA technique as spatial." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"LWPCA (Tipping and Bishop 1999; Skoˇcaj, Leonardis, and Bischof 2007; Hoffmann, Schaal, and Vijayakumar 2009; Charlton et al. 2010) is applied to the situation when the data are not described well by a universal set of PCs but where there are localized regions in attribute data space where a suitably localized set of PCs provide a better description." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"That is, in different parts of the data space, a different set of PCs is needed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"This technique uses a moving window weighting approach in the data space where PCs are found in the locality of some point x in the data space." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"For each individual LWPCA around x, neighboring data points are first weighted according to some distance-decay kernel function (e.g., bi-square, Gaussian, etc.) where Mahalanobis (attribute space) distances of the neighboring points to x are used" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"Each observation is then multiplied by its respective weight and a standard PCA algorithm is (locally) applied to this weighted data" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"The size of the window over which a local PCA might apply is controlled by the bandwidth. Small bandwidth values lead to more rapid variation in the results, whereas very large bandwidths give subspaces increasingly close to the universal (global) PCA solution." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"GWPCA models (Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton 2002; Charlton et al. 2010; Lloyd 2010; Kumar, Lal, and Lloyd in press) are similar to LWPCA models, but in this case it is assumed that there are regions of geographical space in which distinct PCA models apply" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"The technique is identical to LWPCA except that now the distance-decay weights are based on geographical (usually Euclidean)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=12}{Demšar et al 2013:117})
\par
"As for LWPCA, a different PCA is computed for every z, but now the results vary continuously over geographic space and, as such, they can be mapped (Figure 4)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"Spatial" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"patterns in the behavior of local eigenvalues from GWPCA inform on the complexity and local intrinsic dimensionality of the data and could be used for local dimensionality reduction. Local PCs describe local relationships between original variables at each location and could be used to derive local composite indices that depend on local environmental circumstances" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"geographically weighted regression (GWR; Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton 2002), as an alternative to a global PCA orthogonalization in combination with GWR (Bitter, Mulligan, and Dall'erba 2007)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"limited in that there are no associated diagnostics to indicate whether it provides an advantage over its global counterpart." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"Geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA). A local model is calculated at each location based on a geographically weighted subset of neighboring data points. λ1 to λN are eigenvalues, ordered from largest to smallest. PC1 to PCN are principal components, defined as respective eigenvectors." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"Jombart et al. (2008) presented such a spatial modification of PCA (termed sPCA) to investigate the spatial pattern of genetic variability with respect to the (multivariate) genetic characteristics" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"Spatial autocorrelation is measured using Moran's I (Moran 1950) and incorporated within the sPCA algorithm. The sPCA technique provides PC scores that summarize both the aspatial genetic variability in attribute space and the spatial autocorrelation structure in geographical space among the individuals or populations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"Here statistical (Monte Carlo) tests are used to partition the spatial structure into random, local, and global variance patterns, where local patterns are taken to relate to highly negative spatial autocorrelation and global patterns are taken to relate to highly positive spatial autocorrelation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"Applications of sPCA should only be viewed as explorative, especially as its output depends strongly on the particular (often arbitrary) connection" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=13}{Demšar et al 2013:118})
\par
"The sPCA technique can be viewed as a direct alternative to GWPCA for incorporating spatial effects into a PCA, but whereas GWPCA accounts for firstorder (nonstationary) spatial effects, sPCA accounts for second-order (stationary) spatial effects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"A natural extension would be to adapt sPCA locally to provide a GWsPCA hybrid" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"The sPCA technique has strong conceptual links to the multivariate spatial correlation technique of Wartenberg (1985a, 1985b) where both techniques require the computation of a spatial weighting matrix W to account for spatial autocorrelation between spatial units" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"For example, in quantitative geography, the eigenvectors of W are used in spatial filtering where spatial autocorrelation is removed from the residuals of a statistical model and, in turn, can be used for spatial prediction (e.g., see Griffith 1996, 2000; Griffith and Amrhein 1997; Getis and Griffith 2002)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"In the classical geostatistics framework, a univariate spatial prediction algorithm such as ordinary kriging (OK) and its multivariate extension, ordinary cokriging (OCoK), can each be adapted to decompose the data into spatial components. This results in the (univariate) factorial kriging (FK) and multivariate factorial kriging (MFK) algorithms, respectively (Matheron 1982; Goovaerts 1997; Wackernagel 2003)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"Here the geostatistical objective is no longer spatial prediction, but an exploration of the origins of the data, where spatial variability (and covariability for MFK) is investigated at different spatial scales" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"It is only for MFK that applications of PCA are needed. Here PCA is used to decompose the variance-covariance (i.e., coregionalization) matrices that describe the correlation structure of multiple variables at characteristic spatial scales. Outputs from such matrix decompositions are commonly visualized using a circle of correlation plots, one for each spatial scale of interest. Here any significant change in the relationships between variables at the different spatial scales should become immediately apparent." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"Castrignan'o, Buttafouco, and Puddu (2008; MFK)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"The key drawback to any application of FK and MFK is that the output depends wholly on the form of the nested variogram model(s), which tend to be arbitrarily fitted to the empirical variography. In this respect, any nested behavior observed in the empirical variography should always be expertly related to any physical knowledge of the given process" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"Such scale-dependent variation is typically revealed by nested structures in the empirical variogram(s) and cross-variogram(s) for MFK (i.e., our measures of spatial autocorrelation)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=14}{Demšar et al 2013:119})
\par
"We identified a number of studies that claim to use a method termed "spatial PCA"." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=15}{Demšar et al 2013:120})
\par
"The term can refer either to one of the first three methodologies for standard PCA on spatial data (identified in the previous section) or else (and more appropriately) to the spatial adaptation of PCA or sPCA (from two subsections ago)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=15}{Demšar et al 2013:120})
\par
"In most cases "spatial PCA" refers to raster data PCA. Examples are mainly found in the environmental sciences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=15}{Demšar et al 2013:120})
\par
"The second explicit use of the term refers to spatial objects PCA. Two examples that we found were PCA on areas" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=15}{Demšar et al 2013:120})
\par
"We would also like to clarify the difference between spatially weighted PCA (SWPCA) and geographically weighted PCA (GWPCA). SWPCA applies to raster PCA, where each of the input rasters (e.g., bands of RS images) is weighted by another weight raster" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=15}{Demšar et al 2013:120})
\par
"This weight raster is a surface that represents some type of spatial relationship that is important in the context of the respective input raster." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=15}{Demšar et al 2013:120})
\par
"This is not to be confused with GWPCA (see relevant subsection three subsections ago), where geographically local PCA models are calculated at the location of each spatial object in the data set. The two methods, SWPCA and GWPCA, are therefore completely different from one another and are meant for different types of data and for different purposes and should not be confused." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=15}{Demšar et al 2013:120})
\par
"As discussed previously, an early method developed to improve the interpretability of PCA is varimax rotation (Kaiser 1958), which involves rotating the subspace defined by selected PCs so that a small number of the coefficients in the loading vectors have much greater values than the remaining coefficients." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=16}{Demšar et al 2013:121})
\par
"An example of a tensor mode PCA applied in spatial context was given in Leibovici (2010), where it was used to solve a spatiotemporal ecoclimatic delineation problem." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RE9VSDML?page=17}{Demšar et al 2013:122})

These methods have been tested using a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) in combination with point source nocturnal temperature data observed during autochthonous calm and clear weather conditions. The gently undulated test site Melsungen in Northern Hessia features 130 single observation points representing a range of different morphological situations. Assuming the terrain reveals a seasonal varying influence on nocturnal air temperature patterns near ground, a comparative study was carried out between the meteorological transitional period showing active vegetation cover and the colder season without any active vegetation cover. Using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, different terrain parameters have been tested. The results reveal changing influences of terrain attributes on nocturnal air temperature pattern depending on seasonal variations of vegetation cover. During the transitional period, a maximum variance of 55 \% is explained by a combination of different terrain parameters and in the colder season even up to 68 \%.},

  abstract = {We describe an approach for digital mapping of soil properties based on dual use of secondary information. In the first stage, multivariate secondary information is used to stratify a landscape for sampling. A new clustering algorithm was developed for this, which allows conducting spatially constrained cluster analysis using mixed categorical and continuous secondary attributes. The stratification is used to optimise sampling by constrained spatial simulated annealing (CSSA). Sampled values and correlated secondary attributes are then used in simple kriging with varying local means (SKLMs) to perform final mapping. We applied this method to mapping of soil carbon stock (CS) in the top 0.3 m of soil. Using secondary information greatly reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) of CS prediction as compared with ordinary kriging (OK) of sampled CS alone. When sampling intensity was decreased, RMSE increased more with OK than by using SKLM for local prediction. Among the ancillary variables, on-the-go sensed soil electrical conductivity was most useful for CS mapping. Further research should focus on developing a generic framework for thematic soil mapping at different scales. More standardised procedures are required for processing of secondary information, optimising sampling designs and performing local prediction to minimise cost and achieve high precision.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing need for reasonably accurate small-scale soil databases. The compilation of a continental or global-scale soil database requires a lot of spatially and thematically accurate soil data. The aim of this study was to test a method for small-scale soil mapping in Italy usrng Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and digital elevation data. This method was employed in an earlier study in Hungary for a much smaller area and a significantly different soil-forming environment. An Integrated, 45-layer AVHRRterrain database was used for the study, including a digital elevation model (DEM), slope, curvature, aspect, potential drainage density, and the five bands of AVHRR data for eight different dates. The data were processed using the Discriminant Analysis Feature Extraction (DAFE) function, which is based on a canonical analysis procedure. Two types of images (basic and transformed) were classified using the maximum likelihood classifier. Two training sets were chosen that have identical geographic coverage, but differ in the level of soil classification. One set was based on the soil units (SU) of the FAO-revised legend, while the other set represented major soil groupings (MSG). The best 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 layers were selected using the Bhattachryya feature selection method and were then classified. The results of the different sets were compared. The performance of the purely AVHRR and purely terraindata-based images, respectively, were also interpreted. The results indicate that the terrain descriptors alone are not sufficient for soil classification. However, the feature selection algorithms always selected the DEM and its derivatives among the first ones, highlighting their importance for soil-landscape characterization. When using AVHRR data alone, test class performances of 49.8 percent (MSG) and 48.6 percent (SU) were achieved. Integration of terrain data into the AVHRR database produced relatively small improvements (4.6 and 2.8 percent). The best test class performances were achieved when all available channels were used for the classification, namely 51.4 for the FAO’s SUs and 54.4 for the MSGs on the basic image, and 51.7 and 54.4 respectively on the DAFE-transformed images. The most informative AVHRR bands were found to be from the spring period (April-May), while the most abundant bands were the visible-red (band 1) and bands 3 and 4.},

  abstract = {The ability to accurately and precisely perform soil nutrient mapping over large areas is essential in the decisionmaking processes for precision agriculture. However, existing grid-based or non-grid-based digital soil mapping (DSM) can lead to the problem of mixed units of input information, which causes the mapping results to be unsuitable for direct use in guiding the implementation of precision agriculture. Instead, the goal of this study was to achieve DSM based on land parcels, which are the basic units of agricultural management and have practical geographical significance for precision mapping in agricultural areas. This study established a convolutional neural network-based automatic extraction model to extract land parcels from high resolution remote sensing images. Thirty environmental covariates were chosen and calibrated at land parcels to establish the relationships between soils and landscapes. Four prediction algorithms, namely, ordinary kriging, cokriging, random forest and artificial neural network, were combined with the land-parcel-based DSM framework to develop and evaluate their effectiveness in predicting four topsoil nutrient properties in an alluvial-diluvia plain agricultural region located in Ningxia province, China. The results of comparisons show that, overall, the landparcel-based RF model achieved the best prediction accuracy; its relative improvement (RMSE\%) values over the competing models were 1.27, 4.23, 3.19 and 9.01 for soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium, respectively. In addition, land-parcel-based mapping can improve algorithmic efficiency by approximately 4 times by effectively reducing the mapping units for complex agricultural areas compared with the grid-based mapping results when using the same algorithm, and it also achieves a better performance at the detail level. Overall, the land-parcel-based DSM approach achieved good results in plain agricultural areas, but the model still needs improvement for land-parcel-based DSM in mountainous and hilly agricultural areas, and a challenge remains in selecting the most appropriate environmental covariates.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an automated classification system of landform elements based on object-oriented image analysis. First, several data layers are produced from Digital Terrain Models (DTM): elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature and slope gradient. Second, relatively homogenous objects are delineated at several levels through image segmentation. These object primatives are classified as landform elements using a relative classification model, built both on the surface shape and on the altitudinal position of objects. So far, slope aspect was not used in classification. The classification has nine classes: peaks and toe slopes (defined by the altitudinal position or the degree of dominance), steep slopes and flat/gentle slopes (defined by slope gradients), shoulders and negative contacts (defined by profile curvatures), head slopes, side slopes and nose slopes (defined by plan curvatures). Classes are defined using flexible fuzzy membership functions. Results are visually analyzed by draping them over DTMs. Specific fuzzy classification options were used to obtain an assessment of output accuracy. Two implementations of the methodology are compared using (1) Romanian datasets and (2) Berchtesgaden National Park, Germany. The methodology has proven to be reproducible; readily adaptable for diverse landscapes and datasets; and useful in respect to providing additional information for geomorphological and landscape studies. A major advantage of this new methodology is its transferability, given that it uses only relative values and relative positions to neighboring objects. The methodology introduced in this paper can be used for almost any application where relationships between topographic features and other components of landscapes are to be assessed.},

  abstract = {Increasing availability of high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) is leading to a paradigm shift regarding scale issues in geomorphometry, prompting new solutions to cope with multi-scale analysis and detection of characteristic scales. We tested the suitability of the local variance (LV) method, originally developed for image analysis, for multi-scale analysis in geomorphometry. The method consists of: 1) upscaling land-surface parameters derived from a DEM; 2) calculating LV as the average standard deviation (SD) within a 3 × 3 moving window for each scale level; 3) calculating the rate of change of LV (ROC-LV) from one level to another, and 4) plotting values so obtained against scale levels. We interpreted peaks in the ROC-LV graphs as markers of scale levels where cells or segments match types of pattern elements characterized by (relatively) equal degrees of homogeneity. The proposed method has been applied to LiDAR DEMs in two test areas different in terms of roughness: low relief and mountainous, respectively. For each test area, scale levels for slope gradient, plan, and profile curvatures were produced at constant increments with either resampling (cell-based) or image segmentation (object-based). Visual assessment revealed homogeneous areas that convincingly associate into patterns of land-surface parameters well differentiated across scales. We found that the LV method performed better on scale levels generated through segmentation as compared to upscaling through resampling. The results indicate that coupling multi-scale pattern analysis with delineation of morphometric primitives is possible. This approach could be further used for developing hierarchical classifications of landform elements.},

The new method relies on the concept of decomposing land-surface complexity into more homogeneous domains. An elevation layer is automatically segmented and classified at three scale levels that represent domains of complexity by using self-adaptive, data-driven techniques. For each domain, scales in the data are detected with the help of local variance and segmentation is performed at these appropriate scales. Objects resulting from segmentation are partitioned into sub-domains based on thresholds given by the mean values of elevation and standard deviation of elevation respectively. Results resemble reasonably patterns of existing global and regional classifications, displaying a level of detail close to manually drawn maps. Statistical evaluation indicates that most of classes satisfy the regionalization requirements of maximizing internal homogeneity while minimizing external homogeneity. Most objects have boundaries matching natural discontinuities at regional level. The method is simple and fully automated. The input data consist of only one layer, which does not need any pre-processing. Both segmentation and classification rely on only two parameters: elevation and standard deviation of elevation. The methodology is implemented as a customized process for the eCognition® software, available as online download.

The tool detects the number of layers added to a project and segments them iteratively with a multiresolution segmentation algorithm in a bottom-up approach, where the scale factor in the segmentation, namely, the scale parameter (SP), increases with a constant increment. The average LV value of the objects in all of the layers is computed and serves as a condition for stopping the iterations: when a scale level records an LV value that is equal to or lower than the previous value, the iteration ends, and the objects segmented in the previous level are retained. Three orders of magnitude of SP lags produce a corresponding number of scale levels. Tests on very high resolution imagery provided satisfactory results for generic applicability. The tool has a significant potential for enabling objectivity and automation of GEOBIA analysis.},

  abstract = {Spatial information on soil properties is an important input to hydrological models. In current hydrological modelling practices, soil property information is often derived from soil category maps by the linking method in which a representative soil property value is linked to each soil polygon. Limited by the area-class nature of soil category maps, the derived soil property variation is discontinuous and less detailed than high resolution digital terrain or remote sensing data. This research proposed dmSoil, a datamining-based approach to derive continuous and spatially detailed soil property information from soil category maps. First, the soil–environment relationships are extracted through data mining of a soil map. The similarity of the soil at each location to different soil types in the soil map is then estimated using the mined relationships. Prediction of soil property values at each location is made by combining the similarities of the soil at that location to different soil types and the representative soil property values of these soil types. The new approach was applied in the Raffelson Watershed and Pleasant Valley in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, United States to map soil A horizon texture (in both areas) and depth to soil C horizon (in Pleasant Valley). The property maps from the dmSoil approach capture the spatial gradation and details of soil properties better than those from the linking method. The new approach also shows consistent accuracy improvement at validation points. In addition to the improved performances, the inputs for the dmSoil approach are easy to prepare, and the approach itself is simple to deploy. It provides an effective way to derive better soil property information from soil category maps for hydrological modelling. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Analysis based on such data sets may generate inconsistent results that will not benefit the users. The opportunity to review and adapt soil-mapping practices came with the initiative taken by the European Commission to position the establishment and operation of an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe under a legal framework, the INSPIRE Directive. The proposed Directive includes minimum requirements for harmonising, documenting and disseminating spatial data. Member States will be asked to establish and operate infrastructures for different spatial themes in accordance with a set of technical guidelines still to be defined and approved. Over the last 10 years, the European Soil Bureau Network has gained much experience in establishing harmonised soil data for Europe and can, therefore, provide an ideal area of experimentation for the practical implementation of the recommended technical guidelines. This chapter reviews some of the changes to be made to the 1:1,000,000 scale European Soil Database to fulfil the INSPIRE requirements.},

Their development has been studied worldwide for more than a century involving various disciplines and resulting in large amounts of data concerning their evolution. In this article, the geographical distribution of calcrete has been studied by combining Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and statistical analysis. In this paper, we present a qualitative approach that incorporates topographic, geological, hydrogeological and climatic data as well as field observations. After getting all four parameters, they were divided into classes and an index value has been assigned to each of them according to influence degree on calcrete development. Finally, all the parameters are superimposed to prepare the final map of calcrete distribution. The multivariate statistical analysis techniques used were principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Both methods were performed to discuss the potential relations among the investigated parametres (CaCO3 (\%), Palygorskite (\%), slope (\%)) and calcrete evolution.},

  abstract = {Spatial disaggregation of soil map units involves downscaling existing information to produce new information at a finer scale than that of the original source. Currently, it is becoming a powerful tool to address the spatial distribution of soil information over large areas, where legacy soil polygon maps are the only source of soil information. Because of the high expense of additional resampling, few studies have sought to validate disaggregated soil maps using independent sampling. This study implemented spatial disaggregation approach to measure the quality of soil property predictions derived from disaggregated soil maps, using stratified simple random sampling of a study area of 6848 km2 (11 strata and 135 soil profiles). In a previous study, the existing legacy soil polygon map of Brittany (France) at 1:250,000 scale was spatially disaggregated at 50 m resolution using an algorithm called Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees (DSMART), which uses soil-landscape expert rules of soil distribution in space. By fitting equal-area spline functions, soil properties were then estimated at six depth intervals according to GlobalSoilMap specifications. To validate disaggregated soil maps, two approaches were developed according to the soil attribute nature (continuous or categorical). For categorical soil properties (soil parent material, soil drainage class, soil type and soil depth class), the overall strict purity (the degree to which all classification criterion are respected) by the most probable STU (Soil Typological Unit) map was estimated at 34\%, while the overall average purity reached 70\%. The overall partial soil-type purity reached 60\%, the overall partial parent material purity reached 78\% and the overall partial soil drainage class as well as soil depth class purities reached 65\% and 78\%, respectively. Continuous soil properties (clay content, fine silt content, coarse silt content, total silt content, fine sand content, coarse sand content, coarse fragments, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and pH) were validated at two soil depth intervals (5–15 and 30–60 cm) using 260 soil samples. In general, soil property predictions were unbiased except for coarse fragments and CEC in the 5–15 cm layer. Validation statistics (R2, RMSE, RRMSE and ME) were better for the 30–60 cm layer except for soil particle-size distribution. Thus, differences in prediction accuracies among strata (the validation support) denote areas where more soil data or better soil prediction models are needed to improve the disaggregation process.},

  abstract = {Enhancing the spatial resolution of pedological information is a great challenge in the field of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM). Several techniques have emerged to disaggregate conventional soil maps initially available at coarser spatial resolution than required for solving environmental and agricultural issues. At the regional level, polygon maps represent soil cover as a tessellation of polygons defining Soil Map Units (SMU), where each SMU can include one or several Soil Type Units (STU) with given proportions derived from expert knowledge. Such polygon maps can be disaggregated at finer spatial resolution by machine learning algorithms using the Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees (DSMART) algorithm. This study aimed to compare three approaches of spatial disaggregation of legacy soil maps based on DSMART decision trees to test the hypothesis that the disaggregation of soil landscape distribution rules may improve the accuracy of the resulting soil maps. Overall, two modified DSMART algorithm (DSMART with extra soil profiles, DSMART with soil landscape relationships) and the original DSMART algorithm were tested. The quality of disaggregated soil maps at 50\&amp;\#8201;m resolution was assessed over a large study area (6775\&amp;\#8201;km\&lt;sup\&gt;2\&lt;/sup\&gt;) using an external validation based on independent 135 soil profiles selected by probability sampling, 755 legacy soil profiles and existing detailed 1\&amp;\#8201;:\&amp;\#8201;25\&amp;\#8201;000 soil maps. Pairwise comparisons were also performed, using Shannon entropy measure, to spatially locate differences between disaggregated maps. The main results show that adding soil landscape relationships in the disaggregation process enhances the performance of prediction of soil type distribution. Considering the three most probable STU and using 135 independent soil profiles, the overall accuracy measures are: 19.8\&amp;\#8201;\% for DSMART with expert rules against 18.1\&amp;\#8201;\% for the original DSMART and 16.9\&amp;\#8201;\% for DSMART with extra soil profiles. These measures were almost twofold higher when validated using 3\&amp;\#8201;\&amp;\#215;\&amp;\#8201;3 windows. They achieved 28.5\&amp;\#8201;\% for DSMART with soil landscape relationships, 25.3\&amp;\#8201;\% and 21\&amp;\#8201;\% for original DSMART and DSMART with extra soil observations, respectively. In general, adding soil landscape relationships as well as extra soil observations constraints the model to predict a specific STU that can occur in specific environmental conditions. Thus, including global soil landscape expert rules in the DSMART algorithm is crucial to obtain consistent soil maps with clear internal disaggregation of SMU across the landscape.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Attention focuses on the use of wavelets to distinguish patterns of interest for precision agriculture at several scales. A general procedure for analyzing these images is presented and applied to a single field in the Netherlands, monitored at four different days during one growing season. Wavelet decomposition of the images is capable to reveal and quantify patterns present at different resolution levels and directions and to filter information that is less relevant for precision agriculture applications. Wavelet approximation with different wavelet functions is useful within the backward-looking and the forward-looking approaches of decision-making by allowing adaptation of the analysis to the characteristics of the available images or maps and to the possibilities of the existing sitespecific instruments, respectively.},

The experimental agricultural enterprise "Minino", located near the city of Krasnoyarsk, was chosen as a pilot project. For this agricultural enterprise, the comprehensive digital model using geographic information systems, remote sensing and web mapping data processing techniques and software is created. A geospatial database, which contains relevant and archival information about agricultural fields, varieties, crops, soil, particle size distribution, soil-forming rocks, terrain features, has been developed. A series of technological digital maps and cartograms have been created in which information on crop rotations and cultivated crops is concentrated. Archives of available multispectral satellite data of high spatial resolution on the considered territory are analyzed. As a result, a multi-layer electronic map of the agricultural enterprise was created, which contains all available information and can be used for modeling and forecasting crop yields, agricultural planning. The developed methods and software and technological solutions can become a methodological basis for a new generation of information and analytical systems and technologies to support management decisions in the agricultural sector.},

  abstract = {Color is an important parameter in Soil Science, widely used since the very first soil investigations. Color visually estimated in the field with the Munsell Atlas is used for soil identification and classification, for estimating various soil properties and in soil survey and mapping. The difficulties encountered in the first attempts in establishing empirical relationships between surface color and remote sensing data led to use a more scientific approach. In this paper the significance of Munsell soil color versus spectral signature is investigated and discussed with the help of colorimetric concepts and techniques. Different experiments based on field and laboratory spectral reflectance measurements are summarized. Among the results, the transformation of Munsell data into Red, Green, Blue color coordinates (R,G,B) is the basis for a pragmatic, physically based model relating surface color to satellite data in visible bands. Applications of this model to satellite imagery for soil mapping, soil mineralogy studies and arid lands vegetation monitoring are presented, with emphasis on TM data. In conclusion, the promises of remote sensing of surface color for environmental changes monitoring are discussed in anticipation of the new instruments that will fly on polar orbiting platforms at the end of this decade.},

High-resolution DEMs from active remote sensing form a new basis for geomorphological work, which is moving on from consideration of whether data are accurate enough to how the surface of interest can be defined from an overabundance of data. Discussion of the operational definition and delimitation of specific landforms of varying degrees of difficulty, from craters to mountains, is followed by the applicability of ‘fuzzy’ boundaries. Scaling, usually allometric, is shown to be compatible with the scale-specificity of many landforms: this is exemplified by glacial cirques and drumlins. Classification of a whole land surface is more difficult than extraction of specific landforms from it. Well-dissected fluvial landscapes pose great challenges for areal analyses. These are tackled by the delimitation of homogeneous elementary forms and/or land elements in which slope position is considered. The boundaries are mainly breaks in gradient or aspect, but may also be in some type of curvature: breaks in altitude are rare. Elementary forms or land elements are grouped together into functional regions (landforms) such as ‘hill sheds’. It may often be useful to recognise fuzziness of membership, or core and periphery of a surface object.},

  abstract = {"The majority of data sets collected by researchers in all disciplines are multivariate, meaning that several measurements, observations, or recordings are taken on each of the units in the data set. These units might be human subjects, archaeological artifacts, countries, or a vast variety of other things. In a few cases, it may be sensible to isolate each variable and study it separately, but in most instances all the variables need to be examined simultaneously in order to fully grasp the structure and key features of the data. For this purpose, one or another method of multivariate analysis might be helpful, and it is with such methods that this book is largely concerned. Multivariate analysis includes methods both for describing and exploring such data and for making formal inferences about them. The aim of all the techniques is, in general sense, to display or extract the signal in the data in the presence of noise and to find out what the data show us in the midst of their apparent chaos. An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R explores the correct application of these methods so as to extract as much information as possible from the data at hand, particularly as some type of graphical representation, via the R software. Throughout the book, the authors give many examples of R code used to apply the multivariate techniques to multivariate data."--Publisher's description},

  abstract = {Area-pedodiversity, area–vegetation diversity, area-bioclimatic belts, diversity and pedodiversity-vegetation diversity-bioclimatic diversity relationships were analyzed for the most arid region of Western Europe (SE Spain). The study is novel in that it analyzed these relationships using as operational geographic units (OGUs) the set of polygons belonging to the same character state (i.e., typology) that defines a zone in a given thematic map. We considered three thematic maps: 1) the map of soil associations (SMU) with 303 different soil associations (i.e., 303 areas or zones); 2) the map of potential vegetation (PNV) with 40 vegetation series or zones and 3) the map of bioclimatic belts (BB) with 7 bioclimatic zones. Using GIS tools, we analyzed the contents (richness) of soil mapping units (polygons) with regard to vegetation series and bioclimatic belts as well as the contents of vegetation series and bioclimatic belts with regard to SMU. The results indicate that the relationships between the area and the richness of zones follow a power law, the “fingerprint of fractal geometry”, irrespective of the way the area has been defined and their relative magnitude (the areas defined by SMU are the smallest, while the areas defined by bioclimatic belts are the largest). The results also indicate a significant correlation between the α diversities of the zones and between their β diversities. We conclude that the methods used to measure such correlations, based on α and β diversities are useful to investigate and quantify the relationships between the pedosphere, vegetation and climate.},

  abstract = {Fuzzy clustering is used extensively in several domains of research. In the literature, starting from the well-known fuzzy k-means (fkm) clustering algorithm, an increasing number of papers devoted to fkm and its extensions can be found. Nevertheless, a lack of the related software for implementing these algorithms can be observed preventing their use in practice. Even the standard fkm is not necessarily available in the most common software. For this purpose, a new toolbox for fuzzy clustering using the R programming language is presented by examples. The toolbox, called fclust, contains a suit of fuzzy clustering algorithms, fuzzy cluster validity indices and visualization tools for fuzzy clustering results.},

"As already observed, the hard approach to clustering may fail because its black-and-white nature is too rigid to handle the real-life complexity. In the fuzzy k-means (fkm) algorithm objects are assigned to the clusters according to a certain degree (gray-scale nature)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=4}{Ferraro et al 2015:4})
\par
"For every object, the sum of the membership degrees in all the clusters must be equal to 1." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=4}{Ferraro et al 2015:4})
\par
"The membership degrees express the uncertainty related to the assignments of the objects to the clusters" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=4}{Ferraro et al 2015:4})
\par
"In order to tune the fuzziness of the solution, the fuzziness parameter m is used." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=4}{Ferraro et al 2015:4})
\par
"A recognized limit of fkm is that it produces only clusters with spherical shape because the homogeneity of the clusters is expressed in terms of the Euclidean distance." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=5}{Ferraro et al 2015:5})
\par
"Of course, its applicability may be prevented whenever non-spherical clusters are expected." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=5}{Ferraro et al 2015:5})
\par
"Clusters of ellipsoidal shape are found by replacing the standard Euclidean distance with a cluster-specific Mahalanobis distance:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=5}{Ferraro et al 2015:5})
\par
"In fkm as well as in the Gustafson-Kessel extension, the fuzziness of the obtained solution is achieved by introducing the fuzziness parameter m. Although it works well in practice, the use of m presents at least two drawbacks." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=5}{Ferraro et al 2015:5})
\par
"First of all, it appears to be an artificial device without a clear physical meaning, lacking a theoretical justification." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=5}{Ferraro et al 2015:5})
\par
"Furthermore, it implies that the centroids are obtained as weighted means of the variables with 'anomalous' weights. Specifically, such weights are equal to the membership degrees at the power of m, whereas it would be more natural to simply consider the membership degrees" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=5}{Ferraro et al 2015:5})
\par
"remove the fuzziness parameter and replace the fuzzifying role of m by adding the following regularization term in the loss function:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=6}{Ferraro et al 2015:6})
\par
"The term in (4) resembles the Shannon probabilistic entropy and can be interpreted as a measure of entropy for fuzzy sets taking into account that it is applied to the fuzzy membership degrees." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=6}{Ferraro et al 2015:6})
\par
"where t is a non-negative weighting parameter measuring the degree of fuzzy entropy." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=6}{Ferraro et al 2015:6})
\par
"In all of the above algorithms clusters are represented by centroids. The concept of centroids may be not easy to understand for practitioners because centroids are artificial objects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=7}{Ferraro et al 2015:7})
\par
"Rather than characterizing clusters by means of centroids, it can be helpful to require that the cluster prototypes must be a subset of the observed objects. Such a subset denotes the so-called medoids. In the non-fuzzy approach, the concept of medoid has been introduced by Kaufman and Rousseeuw [18, 19], who develop the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm. PAM has been extended according to the fuzzy approach in [23, 24]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=7}{Ferraro et al 2015:7})
\par
"In such cases, the medoids usually are more stable and informative in order to characterize the clusters. In this respect, the fuzzy k-medoids algorithm can be seen as a robust method for clustering." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=7}{Ferraro et al 2015:7})
\par
"All the fuzzy clustering approaches, analyzed in the previous sections, can be extended with the introduction of a noise cluster." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=8}{Ferraro et al 2015:8})
\par
"In order to choose the proper number of clusters a lot of cluster validity indices have been proposed" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=8}{Ferraro et al 2015:8})
\par
"Two well-known indices are, respectively, the partition coefficient (PC) and the partition entropy (PE)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=8}{Ferraro et al 2015:8})
\par
"PC takes values in the range [1/k, 1]. The optimal number of cluster k is achieved when the index value is maximized over different values of k" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=8}{Ferraro et al 2015:8})
\par
"The optimal number of clusters k is achieved when the index value is minimized." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=9}{Ferraro et al 2015:9})
\par
"A popular cluster validity index, the silhouette, has been developed in [19]. To distinguish it from the fuzzy version, henceforth we refer to it as crisp (non-fuzzy) silhouette (CS)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=9}{Ferraro et al 2015:9})
\par
"Obviously, the optimal number of clusters k is obtained when CS is maximized." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=10}{Ferraro et al 2015:10})
\par
"The cluster validity indices, recalled in the previous section, are used to evaluate the fuzzy clustering results. Nevertheless, they reduce the information of a large dataset to a single value. For this reason, in order to further inspect the results, it can be convenient to consider visualization techniques." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=10}{Ferraro et al 2015:10})

\par
"The second visualization consists in a scatter plot whose coordinates, for each object (point) xi, are uig1 and uig2 that represent, respectively, the highest membership degree of xi and the second highest." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=10}{Ferraro et al 2015:10})
\par
"A different strategy is adopted by Bezdek and Hathaway [5]. They propose a tool for visual assessing of (cluster) tendency (VAT). It is used to discover the optimal number of clusters existing in the data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W5CP4QN4?page=11}{Ferraro et al 2015:11})

  abstract = {The study of the geological identity of rare vineyards introduces new classification approaches for the geological natural environment, which is sometimes underestimated in agriculture. This research examines the geological features related to quaternary soil sediments in the Italian Alps, near the village of Tramin. The local winemakers have constantly encountered differences between vineyards over the decades, such as growth of vines and quality of the grapes and wine, even in Gewürtztraminer vineyards close to each other. A detailed geological territorial study with more precise classification at the vineyard scale would therefore be significant, because it could explain the source of these differences. A new term for this approach, Vineyard Geological Identity (VGI), has been coined. The purpose is to standardize the geological information and enhance scientific comparisons between vineyards, but it is also useful for vintners as they attempt to obtain scientific confirmation for their personal observations or for supporting the territorial subdivision provided by the wine's product quality specification. Our findings show a very marked variability of sediments in the study area and how the more recent geological processes are directly related to their varied chemical and mineralogical distributions. Many dolomitic or silicate soil sediments marked by different history, and therefore with different chemical and physical properties, lie adjacent in a very restricted territory. Some of the analysed vineyards are evidently siliciclastic, whereas others are mostly carbonate. In adjacent vineyards, the content of carbonate mineral can range from 36.3\% to 0.6\%. A marked alternation of layers with different mineralogy can typify the sediment layers where the grapevine root systems grow. The Mn and dolomitic Mg mean concentration were 1.1 mg/kg and 343 mg/kg, respectively, in strictly siliciclastic layers compared with 6.9 mg/kg and 1081 mg/kg in the more carbonate layers. Several minerals characterize the different sediments, and relations between some of them and the fruit orchard soil reaction classes were found. Further studies should verify direct links with the biochemical processes related to the variable mineral macronutrients observed. A correct geopedological classification and mapping of both the sediments and related soils are essential to eliminate incongruities in the interdisciplinary data.},

Producers’ perspectives have led to several measures of accuracy and precision that describe the intrinsic quality of the produced soil map and information system. These are described in some detail. In conclusion, it seems that adequate measures lack the ability to detect and quantify logical inconsistencies resulting from joining and harmonisation of existing maps. Additionally, indicators need to be developed that assess the semantic quality of maps while accounting for the taxonomic distance between the map units. Users’ perspectives lead to a different view on map quality. Some minimal data sets of error are proposed that will enable users to incorporate soil map uncertainty into their applications.},

  abstract = {Recent research on the identification of landscape morphometric units has recognised that those units have a vague spatial extent which may be modelled by fuzzy sets. To date most such have looked at the landscape at a single resolution although scale dependence is one of the reasons the concepts are vague. The fact is that the allocation of landscape elements to morphometric classes is ambiguous, and in this chapter we exploit the ambiguity of multi-resolution classification as the basis of the morphometric classes as fuzzy sets. We explore this idea with respect to both the mountains around Ben Nevis in Scotland and the dynamic environment of a coastal dunefield. The results in the first example show that the landscape elements identified correspond to landmarks named in a placename database of the area, although many more peaks are found than are named in the available database. In the second case multi-temporal data on a dynamic coastal dunefield is used to show results for fuzzy set and fuzzy logic analysis to identify patterns of change which contrast with more traditional change analysis. Both examples provide new insights over the types of analysis which are currently available in Geographical Information Systems, and the manipulation of scale to parameterise membership of the fuzzy set is a uniquely geographical method in fuzzy set theory.},

  abstract = {Multi-temporal satellite imagery can be composited over a season (or other time period) to produce imagery which is representative of that period, using techniques which will reduce contamination by cloud and other problems. For the purposes of vegetation monitoring, a commonly used technique is the Maximum NDVI Composite, used in conjunction with variety of other constraints. The current paper proposes an alternative based on the medoid (in reflectance space) over the time period (the medoid is a multi-dimensional analogue of the median), which is robust against extreme values, and appears to be better at producing imagery which is representative of the time period. For each pixel, the medoid is always selected from the available dates, so the result is always a single observation for that pixel, thus preserving relationships between bands. The method is applied to Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery to create seasonal reflectance images (four per year), with the aim being a regular time series of reflectance values which captures the variability at seasonal time scales. Analysis of the seasonal reflectance values suggests that resulting temporal image composites are more representative of the time series than the maximum NDVI seasonal composite.},

  abstract = {We investigated two approaches for large-scale analysis and prediction of the spatial distribution of soil properties in an agricultural landscape in the Canadian prairies. The first approach was based on the implementation of nine types of digital terrain models (DTMs) and regression analysis of soil and topographic data. The second approach used a concept of accumulation, transit, and dissipation zones of the landsurface. Soil properties were soil moisture, residual phosphorus, solum thickness, depth to calcium carbonate, and organic carbon content. The dependence of soil properties on topography was supported by correlations for the upper soil layer. However, topographic control of soil moisture and residual phosphorus decreased with depth. Also, correlation coefficients and regression equations describing topographic control of soil moisture and residual phosphorus differed among seasons. This imposes limitations on regression-based predictions of the spatial distribution of soil properties. The prediction of soil property distribution with the concept of accumulation, transit and dissipation zones can be more successful and appropriate than the prediction based on linear regression. The variability in relationships between soil and topographic characteristics with depth may stem from spatial variability in the rate of decline of hydraulic conductivity with depth. Temporal variability in soil–topography relationships occurs because soil properties result from interactions of a variety of pedogenetic factors and processes marked by different temporal variability. In soil studies with digital terrain modelling, there is a need to take into account four types of variability in relations between soil and relief: regional, temporal, depth, and scale.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"If one carries out a study with a regular grid of sampling points, the problem reduces to determination of a grid spacing. The success of an investigation depends on the correct solution of this problem." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAYRVYQL?page=170}{Florinsky 2012:170})
\par
"This is a critical question because different physical laws and landscape processes dominate at different spatial scales." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAYRVYQL?page=170}{Florinsky 2012:170})
\par
"However, the problem cannot be solved merely by using data sets with the same resolutions and grids. The situation is complicated by the fact that adequate areas are not correlated with "basic" landscape units, such as stow and facies (Phillips, 1988)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAYRVYQL?page=172}{Florinsky 2012:172})
\par
"Therefore, a correct choice of w is one of the main problems of DTMbased soil studies. In this chapter, we describe the author's method for determining the adequate grid spacing of DTMs used to analyze and model soil properties (Florinsky and Kuryakova, 2000)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAYRVYQL?page=172}{Florinsky 2012:172})
\par
"Use of the method is exemplified by studying relationships between topography and soil moisture." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAYRVYQL?page=172}{Florinsky 2012:172})
\par
"If one can find borders between the patches, it is desirable to study this property separately at each patch. However, one can observe the interval 4 wherein property values have low variability at all three patches (Fig. 9.1c)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAYRVYQL?page=174}{Florinsky 2012:174})
\par
"So, to determine a common adequate interval of areas and grid spacing providing the correct combined study of two properties, one should (1) analyze the correlation between these properties observed with different grid spacings; and (2) plot correlation coefficients versus w (similarly to Fig. 9.1a)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAYRVYQL?page=175}{Florinsky 2012:175})
\par
"To define adequate w, one should carry out the following procedures:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAYRVYQL?page=175}{Florinsky 2012:175})
\par
"Derive a set of DTMs using a series of w. • Perform a correlation analysis of data on a landscape property and a morphometric variable estimated with various values of w. • Plot correlation coefficients between the landscape property and the morphometric variable versus w. • Determine smooth portions of the graph, which indicate intervals of adequate w." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AAYRVYQL?page=175}{Florinsky 2012:175})
\par
"DEM and data on a landscape property are obtained using the same square grids with a grid spacing w. One can then derive a set of digital models of a morphometric variable concerned from the DEM using grid spacings w, 2w, 3w,..., nw; n is an integer.

  abstract = {Geomorphometry is widely used to solve various multiscale geoscientific problems. For the successful application of geomorphometric methods, a researcher should know the basic mathematical concepts of geomorphometry and be aware of the system of morphometric variables, as well as understand their physical, mathematical and geographical meanings. This paper reviews the basic mathematical concepts of general geomorphometry. First, we discuss the notion of the topographic surface and its limitations. Second, we present definitions, formulae and meanings for four main groups of morphometric variables, such as local, non-local, two-field specific and combined topographic attributes, and we review the following 29 fundamental morphometric variables: slope, aspect, northwardness, eastwardness, plan curvature, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, difference curvature, horizontal excess curvature, vertical excess curvature, accumulation curvature, ring curvature, minimal curvature, maximal curvature, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, unsphericity curvature, rotor, Laplacian, shape index, curvedness, horizontal curvature deflection, vertical curvature deflection, catchment area, dispersive area, reflectance, insolation, topographic index and stream power index. For illustrations, we use a digital elevation model (DEM) of Mount Ararat, extracted from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 1-arc-second DEM. The DEM was treated by a spectral analytical method. Finally, we briefly discuss the main paradox of general geomorphometry associated with the smoothness of the topographic surface and the non-smoothness of the real topography; application of morphometric variables; statistical aspects of geomorphometric modelling, including relationships between morphometric variables and roughness indices; and some pending problems of general geomorphometry (i.e. analysis of inner surfaces of caves, analytical description of non-local attributes and structural lines, as well as modelling on a triaxial ellipsoid). The paper can be used as a reference guide on general geomorphometry.},

  abstract = {In South Africa, the only soil resource available with full spatial coverage is the national resource inventory. Disaggregating this polygon-based inventory, is thus a logical step to create more detailed soil maps covering the entire country. The polygons are large in area encompassing complex soil-terrain patterns and research into disaggregation techniques has been limited. This study aimed to compare 10 algorithms, implemented through a modified DSMART (“Disaggregating and Harmonizing Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees”) model, in their ability to disaggregate two polygons into soil associations in two environmentally contrasting locations. One site had high relief and strong catenal sequences (eastern KwaZulu-Natal Province) and the other site had low relief and a strong geological control of soil types (northern Eastern Cape Province). The algorithms compared were based on previous studies which included k-nearest neighbour, nearest shrunken centroid, discriminatory analysis, multinomial logistics regression, linear and radial support vector machines, decision trees, stochastic gradient boosting, random forest, and neural networks. The method involves stratifying the polygons with landform elements, randomly sampling the landform elements, allocating the soil classes based on the resource inventory, and predicting soil associations across a stack of covariates. This was done in an iterative process, creating multiple realisations of the soil distribution. The performance of each algorithm was based on their kappa and uncertainties. It was found that in general, robust linear models which either utilise an embedded feature selection or regularise covariates, performed best. In the area with high relief and clear toposequences, nearest shrunken centroid was the top performing algorithm with a kappa of 0.42 and an average uncertainty of 0.22. In the area with relatively low relief and complex geology, the results were unsatisfactory. However, a regularised multinomial regression was the top performing algorithm, achieving a kappa of 0.17 and an average uncertainty of 0.84. The results of this study highlight the versatility of a technique to disaggregate South Africa's national resource inventory, where algorithms can be chosen on expert knowledge, model averaging can be performed, the top performing algorithm can be chosen, and algorithm parameters can be optimised.},

  abstract = {Spatial information on soil particle size distribution and soil organic carbon (SOC) are important for land-use management, environmental models and policy-making. Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques can quantitatively predict these soil properties using minimal resources. However, DSM has not been adequately evaluated at the farm-scale. The aim of this study was to optimise the DSM framework to produce farm-scale soil maps for 366 ha in the Sandspruit catchment, Western Cape, South Africa. Four feature selection techniques and eight predictive models were evaluated on their ability to predict particle size distribution and SOC. A boosted linear feature selection produced the highest accuracy for all but one soil property. The top-performing predictive models were robust linear models for gravel (ridge regression, RMSE 9.01\%, R{$\mkern1mu$}2 0.75), sand (support vector machine, RMSE 4.69\%, R{$\mkern1mu$}2 0.67), clay (quantile regression, RMSE 2.38\%, R{$\mkern1mu$}2 0.52) and SOC (ridge regression, RMSE 0.19\%, R{$\mkern1mu$}2 0.41). Random forest was the best predictive model for silt content (RMSE 4.12\%, R{$\mkern1mu$}2 0.53). This approach appears to be robust for farm-scale soil mapping where the number of observations is often small but high-resolution soil data are required.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of soil depth spatial variability is important for land use management especially in dryland agriculture regions, which rely on climate and soils to provide adequate water and nutrients during the growing season. Soil spatial variability can be predicted from legacy soil data through machine learning techniques producing quantitative soil maps requiring minimal resources. South Africa has a country wide 1:250,000 scale resource map known as the Land Type Survey (LTS) which includes soil properties such as soil depth, soil class, root limiting layer, clay content, and texture. Each LTS polygon (land type), is comprised of unique soil – terrain patterns and is therefore, not a true soil map. This study aims to disaggregate the LTS into a farm-scale soil depth class map through a two-step disaggregation approach. First, landform elements were predicted through a pattern recognition algorithm known as geomorphons. Geomorphons, together with the original LTS were overlaid to produce polygons with unique distributions of soil. The polygons were disaggregated further to produce a raster map of soil depth classes through a soil map disaggregation algorithm known as DSMART. The first most probable class raster achieved an accuracy of 68\% and for the two most probable class rasters, an accuracy of 91\% was achieved. The two-step approach proved necessary for producing a farm-scale soil map. The result of this study is significant as it produced a soil depth class map from a national resource map at a scale and resolution (10 m) suitable for farm management.},

The soil information contained in the LTS includes local soil classes (soil series), soil depth ranges, root limiting layer, clay percent, and texture."

(\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VEUNSPP?page=1}{Flynn et al 2019:1136})
\par
"The LTS was developed in a hierarchical structure that is spatially scaled from the top down. At the top, are climatic regions which divide the country. Within each climatic region, areas are dissected by uniform patterns of landform elements (LFEs) and repeating soil patterns which are restricted to the individual polygons on the 1:250,000 map."

"There are many difficulties facing the disaggregation of the LTS, such as the coarse spatial extent, coarse feature scale, and the fact that the LTS does not have true soil polygons." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VEUNSPP?page=2}{Flynn et al 2019:1137})

"The coarse spatial extent and feature scale of the LTS was necessary for nationwide coverage; however, this information is too coarse for land use management. To generatefiner-scale soil information," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VEUNSPP?page=2}{Flynn et al 2019:1137})
\par
"LFEs must be classified to disaggregate the coarse land type polygons into basic LFEs that have associated soil attributes. In doing so, the LTS can be stratified into disaggregated polygons with more homogenous distribution of soil." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VEUNSPP?page=2}{Flynn et al 2019:1137})

"There are many LFEs classification algorithms which include nested-clustering methods (Iwahashi and Pike, 2007), fuzzy landform classification (Irvin et al., 1997; Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004), object-based classification (Dragut, 2011), and more."

"Developed by Jasiewicz and Stepinski (2013), geomorphons is a pattern recognition algorithm created to be computationally efficient, flexible to scale, and can correspond to slope position.

(\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VEUNSPP?page=2}{Flynn et al 2019:1137})
\par
"Other factors making the disaggregation of the LTS difficult is that there are very few georeferenced soil profiles and many land types do not have any georeferenced soil profiles." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VEUNSPP?page=2}{Flynn et al 2019:1137})
\par
"The lack of soil profiles makes updating the LTS problematic without an additional soil survey. Additionally, the LTS was developed by different soil scientists who surveyed different land types and the understanding of how to delineate the land types developed through its creation. Therefore, different soil environmental rules were established depending on who the surveyor was and the time of the survey."

"There are many approaches that have been developed that incorporate existing resource inventories into the DSM framework (Grunwald, 2006; Minasny and McBratney, 2016; Scull et al., 2003). These techniques include geostatistics, expert knowledge systems, and machine learning algorithms which have been successfully applied through kriging with external drift (Kempen et al., 2015), fuzzy logic (MacMillan et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011), k-means clustering (Bui and Moran, 2001), decision trees (Nauman and Thompson, 2014; Sarmento et al., 2017; Subburayalu et al., 2014), and random forest (Häring et al., 2012; Nauman et al., 2014).

"Odgers et al. (2014) who developed DSMART, showed DSMART's potential by disaggregating a soil legacy map in central Queensland, Australia. The authors achieved a 22.5\% accuracy for thefirst most probable class raster. However, the three most probable class rasters combined, classified 50\% of the soil classes correctly. Vincent et al.

  abstract = {Landform elements (LFEs) are commonly used in soil science to demark pedological boundaries and as a first indication of soil spatial variability. A novel LFE classification system known as geomorphons, has been shown to be able to overcome limitations of other automated LFE classifiers. The pattern recognition algorithm classifies the 10 most common LFEs, is computationally efficient, and is robust to changes in scale. However, due to their novelty, research into geomorphons has been limited. This study aimed to stratify the soil landscape through an aggregated geomorphon at the farm-scale (1:25 000) in the Western Cape, South Africa (33.25° S and 18.20° E). Twenty-four geomorphons were created at different resolutions and their association with soil classes were compared. The best fitting geomorphon was aggregated into a 5-unit system corresponding to the South African national resource inventory. The aggregation was based on a decision tree corresponding to soil type. The 5-unit system was evaluated on how well the system stratified soil associations, soil lightness, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon, effective rooting depth (ERD), depth to lithology, gravel, sand, silt, and clay. The prediction potential was compared between the original geomorphon, the aggregated geomorphon, and a manually delineated LFE system. It was found that the aggregated geomorphon stratified all soil attributes except EC. Additionally, the aggregated geomorphon predicted 6 out of 9 soil properties with the greatest accuracy (RMSE). This study shows that aggregating geomorphons can stratify the soil landscape even at the farmscale and can be used as an initial indication of the soil spatial variability. This has implications in resource poor areas where an additional soil survey is not feasible or can be used to aid in the disaggregation of existing soilterrain datasets.},

  abstract = {This study presents a Holocene sediment budget for the upland catchment of the Speyerbach in the Palatinate Forest, southwestern Germany. The influences of both, data availability and the choice of an appropriate soilscape model on the sediment budget calculations are investigated. For budget calculations the spatial distribution of soils was derived from the soil map 1:50,000. Thickness values of soil truncation and colluvial burial were extracted from two soil data sets with varying information content. Data processing contained a disaggregation of the soil map with the help of land use data. In order to model the sediment budget a reference soil thickness (a so-called soilscape model), which represents the initial conditions is necessary. As upland soils are developed in periglacial solifluction sheets, the main solifluction sheet (MSS, “Hauptlage”) showing a constant thickness and being affected by soil forming processes was chosen.},

  abstract = {An unsupervised machine-learning workflow is proposed for estimating fractional landscape soils and vegetation components from remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery. The workflow is applied to EO-1 Hyperion satellite imagery collected near Ibirací, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The proposed workflow includes subset feature selection, learning, and estimation algorithms. Network training with landscape feature class realizations provide a hypersurface from which to estimate mixtures of soil (e.g. 0.5 exceedance for pixels: 75\% clay-rich Nitisols, 15\% iron-rich Latosols, and 1\% quartz-rich Arenosols) and vegetation (e.g. 0.5 exceedance for pixels: 4\% Aspen-like trees, 7\% Blackberry-like trees, 0\% live grass, and 2\% dead grass). The process correctly maps forests and iron-rich Latosols as being coincident with existing drainages, and correctly classifies the clay-rich Nitisols and grasses on the intervening hills. These classifications are independently corroborated visually (Google Earth) and quantitatively (random soil samples and crossplots of field spectra). Some mapping challenges are the underestimation of forest fractions and overestimation of soil fractions where steep valley shadows exist, and the under representation of classified grass in some dry areas of the Hyperion image. These preliminary results provide impetus for future hyperspectral studies involving airborne and satellite sensors with higher signal-to-noise and smaller footprints.},

In the current study, band ratio images (5/3, 5/1, 7/5), and (7/5, 5/4, 3/1) together with supervised classification techniques are used and proved effective for lithological mapping of the serpentinite rocks. Integrating previous knowledge lithological mapping studies of the study area and our visual interpretations of the different enhanced Landsat images, we mapped, in detail, the distribution of the Pan-African serpentinites in the Barramiya area.},

  abstract = {The Hydrology of Soil Types (HOST) classification scheme is based on national soil maps in the UK and has been developed by using expert knowledge to link soil hydrological indicators with conceptual models of surface and subsurface flow pathways through the soil profile. HOST has been optimised by regressing HOST class proportions against the Base Flow Index (BFI) and has been used to estimate catchment hydrological response and as input to land and environmental risk mapping. In this study, we performed spatial disaggregation of HOST class map unit polygons at a 1:250,000 scale in Scotland using the Random Forests (RF) classifier and selected environmental covariates to downscale HOST class mapping to 100 m grid resolution. Training datasets were developed using an area-weighted sampling scheme and by extracting HOST class information simultaneously by both single-class and multiple-class (complex) polygons by using the estimated within-polygon HOST class proportions as weights. The most-probable HOST-RF class maps along with surfaces of HOST class probability of occurrence were generated using 100 realisations from respective RF model runs each using a new training dataset. The performance of the disaggregated HOST-RF class maps for predicting catchment hydrological response was assessed by comparing BFI calculated using RF-predicted HOST class proportions with BFI calculated using flow data from gauges in 90 selected catchments. Results show that in this study using a larger number of training samples increases the risk of overfitting the RF model whereas lower sampling densities of 1 point per km2 were found to be sufficient and capable of promoting effective disaggregation of both single-class and complex polygons. Hydrological response predictions for the study catchments made with the disaggregated HOST-RF classes improved when class proportions were weighted using the generated probability surfaces and were very similar with the ones made with the original HOST class polygons, with small prediction improvements observed in the more low-lying and more slowly-responsive catchments when the HOST-RF classes were used. Overall, validation results indicate that the RF classifier was successful in predicting the spatial distribution of HOST classes in the study area, with the exception of HOST classes found within complex polygons areas dominated by soils with organic horizons of variable depth due to the difficulty of the algorithm to identify clear distinctions based on available covariate values. This study demonstrates the potential of applying digital soil mapping techniques to map soil hydrological functions by using an integrative hydropedological approach which links soils and hydrology at a landscape scale.},

Preparing students ahead of time for a week-long field trip to a new area that involves student-centered learning and a competition to promote student engagement should offer educational advantages. This article presents the results of a poll of teachers who coached students during a week-long soil judging contest field trip. The perspective on learning effectiveness is often asked of students rather than teachers. Five questions were asked and representative answers presented and discussed. The answers of the teacher–coaches were compared with previous literature on the effectiveness of outdoor field trip teaching. The poll results agree that student engagement is related to the combination of an extended field trip to a new resource area with a single subject of focus, practice of professional trade skills, new social interactions, and a contest at the end of the trip. The teacher–coaches enjoyed their opportunity to gain knowledge of subjects they teach from local experts and share social and professional interactions. The responses are important because they lend new perspectives to teaching and coaching not reported in the literature, and explain some educational advantages for outdoor field trip contest activities. Future studies to determine the long-term knowledge gain and retention from such an activity as contrasted with conventional field trips and classroom instruction alone are needed.},

This paper describes a multiscale Kalman smoothing algorithm for removing vegetation effects and smoothing random variations. The algorithm assimilates dense SRTM data, a vegetation mask and sparser but more accurate ICESat satellite laser altimetry data to produce improved estimates of ground height. The method is found to be effective provided the vegetation mask accurately reflects the location of vegetation-induced offsets in the SRTM data. The method also produces estimates of uncertainty in the elevations, facilitating the use of methods for propagating error through derived terrain attributes.},

  abstract = {DEMs derived from dense remotely sensed measurements, including lidar- and radar-based DEMs, provide much greater surface detail than traditional interpolated DEMs but suffer from random noise that perturbs measures of surface shape such as slope and flow direction. Smoothing is an effective method of reducing noise but also tends to impact on important surface features, lowering hilltops, raising valleys and obliterating important fine detail. This paper describes a multiscale adaptive smoothing approach that responds to both the relief and noise level in a DEM by smoothing aggressively where the noise is larger than the local relief and smoothing little or not at all where noise is less than relief. The method is simple and efficient and can be readily implemented in a raster GIS environment. The method is demonstrated on noisy SRTM data.},

  abstract = {Airborne Visible/InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data acquired in 1995 in the vicinity of Campo Verde, central Brazil, were analyzed to investigate the relationships between the mineralogical and chemical composition of different soil types and topography. Band depth analysis following the continuum removal separated areas of exposed soils from the other scene components. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to this subset of pixel spectra of exposed soils. The Spectral Feature Fitting (SFF) technique was used for mineral identification in the scene. Regression relationships between the silica/aluminum ratio and the absorption band depth values at 2210 nm (kaolinite) and 2260 nm (gibbsite), calculated from laboratory spectra after the continuum removal, were used to estimate the Ki index (1.7SiO2/Al2O3) in AVIRIS spectra, an indicator of the degree of soil weathering in soil surveys. Results were plotted over an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)-derived digital elevation model showing that several soil properties varied with surface elevation. Low reflectance soils (e.g., Rhodic Acrustox with negative first component (PC1) scores, clay texture and higher organic carbon, SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and TiO2 content) predominated at higher elevations and high reflectance soils (e.g., Ustic Quartzipsamments with positive PC1 scores, sand texture and lower content of these constituents) at lower elevations. In some portions of the study area, soil composition changed gradually from Rhodic Acrustox at higher elevations to Xanthic Acrustox at lower elevations, or from lower average soil reflectance (negative PC1 scores) and deeper kaolinite absorption band to higher average soil reflectance (positive PC1 scores) and deeper gibbsite absorption band. When applied to AVIRIS data, the laboratory-derived relationship between the Ki index and the depth of the 2210 and 2260 nm absorption bands showed a good correspondence with spectral fits for kaolinite and gibbsite. Kaolinitic areas were associated with high Ki values due to a high SiO2 and low Al2O3 content, whereas gibbsitic areas corresponded to low Ki values and highly weathered soil surfaces due to a low SiO2 and high Al2O3 content.},

  abstract = {Selection of training samples plays an important role in updating conventional soil maps with data mining models. In this paper, we developed a method to determine spatial locations of training samples based on spatial neighborhood analysis of environmental covariates for each soil polygon. Training samples were selected based on a single environmental variable or integrated variables generated using multiple variables. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to test the effect of different spatial neighborhood sizes and selected sample numbers on soil mapping accuracy. Random selection of training samples from soil polygons and soil types respectively were applied to compare with the proposed method in a study area in Raffelson watershed in La Crosse, Wisconsin of USA. Random forest was adopted as the soil prediction model. Results showed that training samples selected using single variables such as Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), slope, plan curvature, profile curvature or slope length factor with the proposed method improved the overall mapping accuracies compared with the conventional soil map, of which using TWI achieved the highest improvement of 27\%. The proposed method using TWI, slope or slope length factor performed better than random selection strategies. Random selection from soil polygons generated higher overall mapping accuracies than from soil types. It was concluded that using composite environmental variables which could represent the soil forming environment of a study area well is recommended when applying the proposed method. The proposed method is not sensitive to the selected sample number, but an appropriate neighborhood size is needed for using the proposed method. In our study area with small spatial coverage, neighborhood size 5 × 5 or 3 × 3 is recommended.},

  abstract = {The Sentinel-2 satellite currently provides freely available multispectral bands at relatively high spatial resolution but does not acquire the panchromatic band. To improve the resolution of 20 m bands to 10 m, existing pansharpening methods (Brovey transform [BT], intensity–hue–saturation [IHS], principal component analysis [PCA], the variational method [P + XS], and the wavelet method) required adjustment, which was achieved using higher resolution multispectral bands in the role of a panchromatic band to fuse bands at a lower spatial resolution. After preprocessing, six bands at lower resolution were divided into two groups because some image fusion methods (e.g. BT, IHS) are limited to a maximum of three input bands of a lower resolution at a time. With respect to the spectral range, the higher resolution band for the first group was synthesized from bands 4 and 8, and band 8 was selected for the second group. Given that one of the main remote sensing applications is land-cover classification, the classification accuracy of the fusion methods was assessed as well as the comparison with reference bands and pixels. The supervised classification methods were Maximum Likelihood Classifier, artificial neural networks, and object-based image analysis. The classification scheme contained five classes: water, built-up, bare soil, low vegetation, and forest. The results showed that most of the fusion methods, particularly P + XS and PCA, improved the overall classification accuracy, especially for the classes of forest, low vegetation, and bare soil and in the detection of coastlines. The least satisfying results were obtained from the wavelet method.},

  abstract = {The success of precision agriculture (PA) depends strongly upon an efficient and accurate method for in-field soil property determination. This information is critical for farmers to calculate the proper amount of inputs for best crop performance and least environmental effect. Grid sampling, as a traditional way to explore in-field soil variation, is no longer considered appropriate since it is labor intensive, time consuming and lacks spatial exhaustiveness. Remote sensing (RS) provides a new tool for PA information gathering and has advantages of low cost, rapidity, and relatively high spatial resolution. Great progress has been made in utilizing RS for in-field soil property determination. In this article, recent publications on the subject of RS of soil properties in PA are reviewed. It was found that a large array of agriculturally-important soil properties (including textures, organic and inorganic carbon content, macro- and micro-nutrients, moisture content, cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, pH, and iron) were quantified with RS successfully to the various extents. The applications varied from laboratoryanalysis of soil samples with a bench-top spectrometer to field-scale soil mapping with satellite hyper-spectral imagery. The visible and near-infrared regions are most commonly used to infer soil properties, with the ultraviolet, mid-infrared, and thermal-infrared regions have been used occasionally. In terms of data analysis, MLR, PCR, and PLSR are three techniques most widely used. Limitations and possibilities of using RS for agricultural soil property characterization were also identified in this article.},

In this study, advances in the spatial representation of hydrological and geomorphological processes using terrain analysis techniques are integrated with the development of a field sampling and soil-landscape model building strategy. Statistical models are developed using relationships between terrain attributes (plan curvature. compound topographic index, upslope mean plan curvature) and soil attributes (A horizon depth, Solum depth, E horizon presencelabsence) in an area with uniform geology and geomorphic history. These techniques seem to provide appropriate methodologies for spatial prediction and understanding soil landscape processes.},

  abstract = {Random Forests are considered for classification of multisource remote sensing and geographic data. Various ensemble classification methods have been proposed in recent years. These methods have been proven to improve classification accuracy considerably. The most widely used ensemble methods are boosting and bagging. Boosting is based on sample re-weighting but bagging uses bootstrapping. The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging. In the paper, the use of the Random Forest classifier for land cover classification is explored. We compare the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier to other better-known ensemble methods on multisource remote sensing and geographic data.},

  abstract = {Object-based classification is a promising technique for image classification. Unlike pixel-based methods, which only use the measured radiometric values, the objectbased techniques can also use shape and context information of scene textures. These extra degrees of freedom provided by the objects allow the automatic identification of geological structures. In this article, we present an evaluation of object-based classification in the context of extraction of geological faults. Digital elevation models and radar data of an area near Lake Magadi (Kenya) have been processed. We then determine the statistics of the fault populations. The fractal dimensions of fault dimensions are similar to fractal dimensions directly measured on remote sensing images of the study area using power spectra (PSD) and variograms. These methods allow unbiased statistics of faults and help us to understand the evolution of the fault systems in extensional domains. Furthermore, the direct analysis of image texture is a good indicator of the fault statistics and allows us to classify the intensity and type of deformation. We propose that extensional fault networks can be modeled by iterative function system (IFS).},

In the R package GWmodel, we present techniques from a particular branch of spatial statistics, termed geographically weighted (GW) models. GW models suit situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localized calibration provides a better description. The approach uses a moving window weighting technique, where localized models are found at target locations. Outputs are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool into the nature of the data spatial heterogeneity. Currently, GWmodel includes functions for: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW regression, and GW discriminant analysis; some of which are provided in basic and robust forms.},

  abstract = {A robust method for spatial prediction of landslide hazard in roaded and roadless areas of forest is described. The method is based on assigning digital terrain attributes into continuous landform classes. The continuous landform classification is achieved by applying a fuzzy k-means approach to a watershed scale area before the classification is extrapolated to a broader region. The extrapolated fuzzy landform classes and datasets of road-related and non road-related landslides are then combined in a geographic information system (GIS) for the exploration of predictive correlations and model development. In particular, a Bayesian probabilistic modeling approach is illustrated using a case study of the Clearwater National Forest (CNF) in central Idaho, which experienced significant and widespread landslide events in recent years. The computed landslide hazard potential is presented on probabilistic maps for roaded and roadless areas. The maps can be used as a decision support tool in forest planning involving the maintenance, obliteration or development of new forest roads in steep mountainous terrain.},

"Burrough et al. (2000) and others (Fisher and Pathirana 1990; Butler 1982; Webster and Oliver 1990; McSweeney et al. 1994) argue that soil spatial variation captured in a soil map is often generalized because of many uncertainties involved in soil mapping. Odeh et al. (1992) suggested that soil variation is more continuous than discrete and therefore an approach that models the soil as a continuum is more appropriate." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=4}{Gorsevski et al 2003:226})

"This method could be used to link prior (known) probabilities of landslide hazard with the fuzzy k-means classes, and consequently assign conditional probabilities." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=5}{Gorsevski et al 2003:227})
\par
"Landforms are more continuous than discrete which calls for a continuous approach to landform classification.

"The fuzzy k-means clustering is the most commonly used technique and has been applied to various disciplines such as climatic modeling (McBratney and Moore 1985), geologic modeling (Bezdek 1981), suburban environment modeling (Fisher and Pathirana 1990), and soil-landscape modeling (McBratney and deGruijter 1992; Odeh et al. 1992; Irvin et al. 1997; Burrough et al. 2000, 2001; MacMillan et al. 2000; Ventura and Irvin 2000)."

"Equation (5) indicates that the sum of membership of an individual across all classes is 1. Equation (6) ensures that at least one individual belongs to each class, so the classes are not empty. Finally, Eq. (7) suggests that an individual belongs to a class or does not belong at all." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=7}{Gorsevski et al 2003:229})

"Fuzzy set theory relaxes Eq. (7) so that class memberships are allowed to be partial and can take on any value between and including 0 and 1 (Eq. (8))." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=7}{Gorsevski et al 2003:229})
\par
"McBratney and deGruijter 1992). Fuzzy c-means (ordinary k-means), as used here, is the best-known classification (Bezdek et al. 1984). The optimal fuzzy classification is achieved by minimization of the objective function to satisfy the conditions in Eqs. (5), (6) and (7). The generalized objective function is given in Eq. (9)."

"and / determines the amount of fuzziness or overlap and is called the fuzzy exponent. For example, when /¼ 1 no overlap is allowed and there is no fuzziness (a "hard class" is generated), for large / there is complete overlap and the clusters are identical. With /{$>$} 1, minimization of JFðM; cÞ is achieved by Langrangian differentiation of Eq. (9) using Picard's iteration (McBratney and deGruijter 1992) with Eqs. (10) and (11):" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=8}{Gorsevski et al 2003:230})

"The third possibility is to compute Mahalanobis-type distances, as used here. This type of distance measurement also compensates for distortions like the diagonal measurement and requires initial data transformation, and accounts for statistically dependent variables (Odeh et al. 1992)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=9}{Gorsevski et al 2003:231})

"Two validity functions, the fuzzy performance index (FPI), and the normalized classification entropy (MPE) (Modified Partition Entropy) are used to evaluate the effects of varying the number of classes. The fuzzy performance index (FPI) as per Minasny and McBratney (2000) is defined" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=10}{Gorsevski et al 2003:232})

\par
"The fuzzy performance index function estimates the degree of fuzziness generated by a specified number of classes, while the normalized classification entropy estimates the degree of disorganization created by a specified number of classes (Minasny and McBratney 2000). After FPI and MPE are calculated the optimum number of continuous and structured classes can be established on the basis of minimizing these two measures (McBratney and Moore 1985)."

\par
"For instance, if / is too low the classes are discrete and the membership value approaches 0 or 1, but if / is too high the classes will not discriminate and classification may fail to converge." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=10}{Gorsevski et al 2003:232})
\par
"Since the goal of the objective function value is to find an optimal balance between structure and continuity, they also argue by choosing a value of / that maximizes the objective function (dJE=d/) generates the "hardest" fuzzy clustering solution." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=10}{Gorsevski et al 2003:232})
\par
"Therefore choosing an optimal combination of classes and fuzzy exponent is established on the basis of minimizing FPI and MPE as described above and choosing the curve with the least maximum of½ðdJE=d/Þc0:5 (Odeh et al. 1992)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=11}{Gorsevski et al 2003:233})
\par
"The confusion index (CI) is a measure of the degree of class overlap in attribute space (Burrough and McDonnell 1998). The concept of a "confusion index" is a measure of how well each individual observation has been classified." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=11}{Gorsevski et al 2003:233})
\par
"The CI is used to translate combined maps of fuzzy memberships into easy to understand crisp zones" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=11}{Gorsevski et al 2003:233})
\par
"If the calculated CI approaches zero, then the observation is more likely to belong to the dominant class, while if the CI approaches one, the difference between the dominant and subdominant classes are negligible which creates confusion in classification of that particular observation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=11}{Gorsevski et al 2003:233})
\par
"After the membership values have been calculated, defuzzification (Burrough et al. 2000) is applied to get a crisp numeric output value. Each observation is assigned to a "hard class" when membership is high (i.e, l 0:7), to an "intragrade" when membership is intermediate, and to an "extragrade" when membership is low." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=11}{Gorsevski et al 2003:233})
\par
"Thus, the continuous landform fuzzy k-means classification may be codified into classes (but not restricted) for examining the relationship between landslide locations and fuzzy classes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=11}{Gorsevski et al 2003:233})
\par
"The Bayesian approach or Bayes Theorem (Malczewski 1999; Skidmore et al. 1996; Aspinall and Veitch 1993; Aspinall 1992) is a method used for decision-making under uncertainty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=11}{Gorsevski et al 2003:233})

"Implementing the Bayesian approach requires the following information: (1) prior knowledge or a priori probabilities that a particular hypothesis is true, and (2) the probability that current evidence is true given that the hypothesis is true (Skidmore et al. 1996; Malczewski 1999)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=12}{Gorsevski et al 2003:234})

"A total of 6 environmental attributes (elevation, slope, profile curvature, tangent curvature, compound topographic index (CTI), and solar radiation) were derived from 30 m DEMs using TAPES-G (Gallant and Wilson 1996) and HEMI (Fu and Rich 2000) software."

"The fuzzy k-means were computed for 2-9 classes with different fuzzy exponents (/). Using the performance measurement criteria of FPI and MPE, the optimal number of classes was computed for the lowest / (1.15) and for the highest / (1.50)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HVP2E7UL?page=14}{Gorsevski et al 2003:236})

"After determining the optimal number of classes, and assuming that no deviation will occur in the number of classes between the lowest and the highest fuzzy exponents, the optimal /½1:15; 1:50 was computed for c¼ 6 at an increment of /¼ 0:05.

  abstract = {The natural complexity of ecological communities regularly lures ecologists to collect elaborate data sets in which confounding factors are often present. Although multiple regression is commonly used in such cases to test the individual effects of many explanatory variables on a continuous response, the inherent collinearity (multicollinearity) of confounded explanatory variables encumbers analyses and threatens their statistical and inferential interpretation. Using numerical simulations, I quantified the impact of multicollinearity on ecological multiple regression and found that even low levels of collinearity bias analyses (r Ն 0.28 or r2 Ն 0.08), causing (1) inaccurate model parameterization, (2) decreased statistical power, and (3) exclusion of significant predictor variables during model creation. Then, using real ecological data, I demonstrated the utility of various statistical techniques for enhancing the reliability and interpretation of ecological multiple regression in the presence of multicollinearity.},

We present a classification of parent material for pedologic purposes, which includes twelve lithology classes based on mineralogical and chemical composition. The relationships of these lithology classes with six key soil properties (soil organic carbon, pH, cation exchange capacity, sum of bases, total P and clay \%) were examined in a case study over New South Wales, Australia. We used multiple linear regression, Random Forest and Cubist tree models based on a soil dataset of over 3200 points. Semi-quantitative estimates are derived of change in these soil properties with a change in lithology class, and an associated silica index, for example, a 22\% relative decrease in soil organic carbon with each 10\% rise in silica, broadly equivalent to a change from shale to granite, assuming other factors remain constant.},

High-resolution auxiliary data such as the soil electrical conductivity (SEC), detailed digital elevation models (DEM), and aerial photographs (APs) and their derivatives carry information on different soil parameters. SEC has very high correlation with soil texture, DEM contain valuable information on soil moisture regime and landscape genesis, and AP carry information on topsoil total organic carbon, TOC. We have developed a system that assists in identifying which auxiliary dataset should be used to determine each map unit boundary width, and thereafter express the boundary as a transition zone between two or more soil types. The method is developed using data from a soil survey on the island of Funen in Denmark and the concept is illustrated in a small strip in this area. A soil database with information on modal soils expresses the degree of drainage, texture and topsoil TOC in each of the mapping units, and we can thereby determine which parameters the bounding map units differ on, and in that way also which dataset should be used for calculating the boundary width.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the potential of using soil-landscape pattern extracted from a soil map to predict soil distribution at unvisited location. Recent machine learning advances used in previous studies showed that the knowledge embedded within soil units delineated by experts can be retrieved and explicitly formulated from environmental data layers However, the extent to which the models can yield valid prediction has been little studied. Our approach is based on a classification tree analysis which has underwent a recent statistics advance, namely, stochastic gradient boosting. We used an existing soil-landscape map to test our methodology. Explanatory variables included classical terrain factors (elevation, slope, curvature plan and profile, wetness index, etc.), various channels and combinations of channels from LANDSAT ETM imagery, land cover and lithology maps. Overall classification accuracy indexes were calculated under two validation schemes, either taken within the training area or from a separated validation area. We focused our study on the accuracy assessment and testing of two modelling parameters: sampling intensity and spatial context integration. First, we observed strong differences in accuracy between the training area and the extrapolated area. Second, sampling intensity, in proportion to the class extent, did not largely influence the classification accuracy. Spatial context integration by the use of a mean filtering algorithm on explanatory variables increased the Kappa index on the extrapolated area by more than ten points. The best accuracy measurements were obtained for a combination of the raw explanatory dataset with the filtered dataset representing regional trend. However, the predictive capacity of models remained quite low when extrapolated to an independent validation area. Nevertheless, this study offers encouragement for the success of extrapolating soil patterns from existing soil maps to fill the gaps in present soil map coverage and to increase efficiency of ongoing soil survey.},

  abstract = {Landform delineation has long been used in digital soil mapping to infer soil-relevant information. While its potential as an environmental variable in soil parameter modeling has been investigated for various automated landform delineations, little research has been invested into the relationship between the delineation of landforms by algorithms based on digital terrain models (DTM) and the perception of landforms by the soil surveyor during field work. Five Open Source automated landform classification algorithms and a support vector machine classifier based on single terrain parameters are investigated with regard to their ability to replicate topographic position, at two different scales, as described by surveyors for soil profile sites in the Alpine environment of South Tyrol. We also analyse how the variation of parameters and cell size affects the distribution of the computed landforms. While a clear trend regarding grid cell size and window size can be observed with regard to the difference between macro and meso scale topographic positions, the overall classification accuracy regarding the different topographic position classes was less promising. Although some automated classifications partly resemble the surveyor's classification, a considerable number of issues remain to be investigated in order to explain the lack of reproducibility of surveyor position, some of which are linked to the Alpine environment of the study area. These include the dominance of the backslope position, the objectivity of the surveyor in rugged terrain under forest cover, and the fuzzy nature of classifying topographic position, especially in steep terrain. By applying a forward stepwise feature selection procedure for a model based on single terrain parameters, we show that at macro scale a regional terrain parameter (topographic wetness index) and curvatures at a coarse DTM resolution of 50 m are the most influential in distinguishing topographic position, whereas at meso scale it is the topographic position index (TPI) with a search radius of just 70 m combined with slope gradient. This study is an important first step towards consolidating topographic perception during field survey and digital terrain analysis, which, at least in Alpine terrain, still requires more investigation.},

\par
"Whereas past publications presenting new landform classification approaches commonly measure the performance of their classification by visual or statistical comparison with existing thematic maps (or classifications performed by human interpretation of photoor topographic maps for validation purposes) or by correlation with metric parameters such as soil depth, the authors deem it important to analyse the classifications performed duringfield work."

\par
"In the next step of the workflow, a stepwise forward feature selection procedure using support vector machine (SVM) classification is applied for each automated landform algorithm in order to derive the parameter combination best suited to classify the landscape (represented by the DTM) according to the surveyor's mental soil-landscape model (represented by the surveyor's generalised topographic position). This means that for each automated landform classification, the parameter setting is chosen with which the SVM classifier can classify the map units of the automated landforms into the generalised topographic positions of the surveyors with the highest accuracy." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JVM7LHLM?page=4}{Gruber et al 2017:12})
\par
"For each automated landform classification algorithm, a number of landform maps are computed applying a wide range of parameter settings. The Forestry data points are then attributed with the various landform units that were computed for their specific locations with the different settings." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JVM7LHLM?page=4}{Gruber et al 2017:12})
\par
"With this model output, it is determined which map units of the automated landform delineations are mapped, or linked, to which generalised topographic positions by the SVM classifier." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JVM7LHLM?page=5}{Gruber et al 2017:13})

"Additionally, we examine how variation of the individual model parameters affect the distribution of landform classes and how they are attributed to the various topographic positions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JVM7LHLM?page=5}{Gruber et al 2017:13})
\par
"Applying a feature selection procedure further allows to investigate whether a multi-scale approach is beneficial for any of the different landform classifications. By also applying this procedure to single terrain derivatives, we investigate how combinations of these derivatives compare to automated classifications and highlight those terrain parameters and landform classifications that contribute most to the description and separation of landforms and slope positions."

  abstract = {Parent material is an important factor of soil formation and consequently plays a dominant role in both traditional field soil survey and digital soil mapping. The emergence of a new generation of detailed geological maps at high spatial resolution in South Tyrol raises the question of how to effectively incorporate these into soil mapping efforts. By comparing the units of these geological maps with the parent material description of soil pits, we evaluate to what extent these can be used as soil parent material maps. Random forest classification and feature selection are applied to highlight those terrain parameters that i) best distinguish between the different surficial geology units, ii) separate soil profile sites with different soil parent material, and iii) can be used together with the geologic map to train a classifier to model the distribution of soil parent material in the study area. The main issue detected by analyzing the differences between the geologic map units and the soil parent material information is the dominant role of till, which acts as soil parent material for a large number of soils located on different geological map units. While slope debris is another class on which geological map and soil pit descriptions often disagree, the issues concerning its misclassification are connected more to categorical transitions between soil parent material classes. Terrain parameters characterizing surface roughness, specifically a combination of vector ruggedness measure (VRM) and topographic roughness index (TRI), were identified as being best suited to join the geological map units in modeling soil parent material and indicate areas where till as soil parent material should be expected. By evaluating these results together with the distribution of soil types, a geologic-topographic characterization is performed for each geological map unit, with the aim of highlighting specific combinations of geological units and topographical situations which should be in the center of future detailed soil surveys, consequently facilitating the soil mapping procedure.},

  abstract = {The Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA) is the first continental version of the GlobalSoilMap concept and the first nationally consistent, fine spatial resolution set of continuous soil attributes with Australia-wide coverage. The SLGA relies on digital soil mapping methods and integrates historical soil data, new measurement with spectroscopic sensors, novel spatial modelling and a web-service delivery architecture. The SLGA provides soil, regolith and landscape estimates at the centre point of 3 arcsecond grid cells (\textasciitilde 90 Â 90 m) across Australia. At each point, there are estimates of 11 soil attributes and confidence intervals for each estimate to a depth of 2 m or less, depth of regolith and a set of terrain descriptors. The information system also includes a library of mid-infrared spectra, an inference engine that allows estimation of additional soil parameters and an information model that enables users to access the system via web services. The explicit mapping of depth, bulk density and coarse fragments allows estimation of material stores and fluxes on a volumetric basis. The SLGA therefore has immediate applications in carbon, nitrogen and water process modelling. The map of regolith depth will find immediate application to studies of vadose zone processes, including solute transport, groundwater and nutrient fluxes beyond the root zone. Landscape attributes at 1 and 3 arcseconds are useful for a wide spectrum of ecological, hydrological and broader environmental applications. The SLGA can be accessed at no cost from www.csiro.au/soil-and-landscape-grid. It is managed and delivered as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).},

  abstract = {Real soil-landscapes are complex consisting of an inextricable mix of patterns and noise varying continuously in the space–time continuum. Soils and parent material show gradual variations in the horizontal and vertical planes forming three-dimensional (3D) bodies that are commonly anisotropic. There is no real beginning and end point in soil-landscapes because environmental conditions are dynamically changed through water flow, biogeochemical processes and human activities. The strengths of soil-landscape modelling lies in hypothesis testing, understanding causal linkages between environmental factors and their interrelationships within a spatial and temporal explicit context. To develop virtual soil-landscape models entails: (i) conceptualisation, that is defining the model framework (e.g. finite space elements); (ii) reconstruction, that is describing and quantifying underlying conditions and behaviour and (iii) scientific visualisation (SciVis), that is abstracting real soil-landscapes into a format that we can comprehend and that helps us to understand the complexity of soil-landscapes. The primary objective in data visualisation is to gain insight into an information space by mapping data onto graphical primitives. Capabilities and limitations of SciVis and virtual reality (VR) techniques are discussed in this chapter. Only recently 3D soil-landscape models have been emerging. We present a case study that translated the spatio-temporal water-table dynamics of a flatwood soil-landscape in Florida into a virtual domain using a geostatistical method to reconstruct the soil-landscape and Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) enhanced with External Authoring Interface (EAI) for visualisation and implementation of interactive functions. Just as maps can visually enhance the spatial understanding of phenomena, interactive spatio-temporal applications can enhance our understanding of complex environmental systems and the underlying transport processes driving soil and water quality.},

  abstract = {The history of digital soil mapping and modeling (DSMM) is marked by adoption of new mapping tools and techniques, data management systems, innovative delivery of soil data, and methods to analyze, integrate, and visualize soil and environmental datasets. DSMM studies are diverse with specialized, mathematical prototype models tested on limited geographic regions and/or datasets and simpler, operational DSMM used for routine mapping over large soil regions. Research-focused DSMM contrasts with need-driven DSMM and agency-operated soil surveys. Since there is no universal equation or digital soil prediction model that fits all regions and purposes the proposed strategy is to characterize recent DSMM approaches to provide recommendations for future needs at local, national and global scales. Such needs are not solely soilcentered, but consider broader issues such as land and water quality, carbon cycling and global climate change, sustainable land management, and more. A literature review was conducted to review 90 DSMM publications from two high-impact international soil science journals — Geoderma and Soil Science Society of America Journal. A selective approach was used to identify published studies that cover the multi-factorial DSMM space. The following criteria were used (i) soil properties, (ii) sampling setup, (iii) soil geographic region, (iv) spatial scale, (v) distribution of soil observations, (vi) incorporation of legacy/historic data, (vii) methods/model type, (viii) environmental covariates, (ix) quantitative and pedological knowledge, and (x) assessment method. Strengths and weaknesses of current DSMM, their potential to be operationalized in soil mapping/modeling programs, research gaps, and future trends are discussed. Modeling of soils in 3D space and through time will require synergistic strategies to converge environmental landscape data and denser soil datasets. There are needs for more sophisticated technologies to measure soil properties and processes at fine resolution and with accuracy. Although there are numerous quantitative models rooted in factorial models that predict soil properties with accuracy in select geographic regions they lack consistency in terms of environmental input data, soil properties, quantitative methods, and evaluation strategies. DSMM requires merging of quantitative, geographic and pedological expertise and all should be ideally in balance.},

  abstract = {The proposed modification of conventional fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) algorithm aims to correct some of its shortcomings. We have focused on as missing flexibility in cluster number adaptation; limited cluster type grouping; less than optimal objective function for clusters of unequal size lying very close to each other; considerable computational time particularly in case of high dimensional data. With M\&MFCM we propose to replace the usual Euclidean distance with Mahalanobis and Minkowski metrics in order to enhance the cluster detection capacity of FCM by allowing more accurate detection of arbitrary shapes of clusters for high dimensional datasets. Direct replacement of Euclidean distance in the objective function of FCM with Mahalanobis might cause numerical problems as the largest eigenvalues of the fuzzy covariance matrix could produce extremely long clusters thus contradicting the real data distribution. The improvement is achieved by fixing the ratio between the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The parameterized Minkowski distance metric is adapted for implementation with FCM with various settings. We also propose an approach for improving the initial choice of cluster number and for visualization and analysis of cluster results for labeled and unlabeled datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed M\&MFCM and test methodology significantly improve FCM clustering results.},

  abstract = {Constructing a cost-effective and detailed digital soil map of Africa will require the extensive utilization of both legacy soil data and legacy soil-landscape knowledge — which in Africa is primarily available from reconnaissance-scale catena or association maps and related studies. We evaluated a hybrid approach for disaggregating reconnaissance scale soil maps: rapid and inexpensive delineation of representative soillandscape units in the field using expert knowledge, followed by the use of inductive, empirical, and correlative modeling techniques to map these landscape units. Our 2214 km2 study area, located in central Uganda, consisted predominantly of catenae that terminate in seasonal valley floor wetlands called dambos — a type of landscape that can be found throughout the African continent. For model training and validation, we identified four landscape classes in the field using published expert knowledge: well-drained uplands (red soils); sloping dambo wetland margins (gradientN 2\%), frequently inundated dambo bottoms (hummocky microtopography), and flat dambo floors (default). Using binary decision trees (BDT) with multispectral and topographic remote sensing covariates, we created a 20 m resolution map of these four classes. Multispectral inputs included reflectance values, vegetation indices, and spectral mixture modeling fractions from Système Pour l'Observacion de la Terre (SPOT) 4 satellite images acquired in December, 2006 and February, 2007. Topographic inputs consisted of a digital elevation model (DEM) from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, slope, and 20 relative elevation layers calculated using moving windows of various sizes. Decision rules were based upon the following input variables: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), the shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance, northing, slope, and two relative elevation layers. The overall classification accuracy of 75.5\% and Kappa coefficient of 0.67 suggest that a combination of multispectral, topographic, and spatial data may be used to reliably classify landscape classes for dambo-terminated catenae. At 59\% of the 2214 km2 study area, the upland class was by far the most abundant, with margins at 21\%, floors at 12\% and bottoms at 8\%. A statistical analysis of soil property data from a small catchment located within the study area showed significant class differences in soil texture, color, organic carbon (SOC), base saturation, pH, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), and clay mineralogy. Though detailed soil maps are rare in Africa, reconnaissance soil maps can be inexpensively disaggregated to provide a valuable starting point for digital soil mapping.},

  abstract = {Detailed knowledge on the spatial distribution of soils is crucial for environmental monitoring, management, and modeling. However soil maps with a finite number of discrete soil map units are often the only available information about soils. Depending on the map scale or the detailing of the map legend this information could be too imprecise. We present a method for the spatial disaggregation of map units, namely the refinement of complex soil map units in which two or more soil types are aggregated. Our aim is to draw new boundaries inside the map polygons to represent a single soil type and no longer a mixture of several soil types. The basic idea for our method is the functional relationship between soil types and topographic position as formulated in the concept of the catena. We use a comprehensive soil profile database and topographic attributes derived from a 10 m digital elevation model as input data for the classification of soil types with random forest models. We grouped all complex map units which have the same combination of soil types. Each group of map units is modeled separately. For prediction of the soil types we stratified the soil map into these groups and apply a specific random forest model only to the associated map units. In order to get reliable results we define a threshold for the predicted probabilities at 0.7 to assign a specific soil type. In areas where the probability is below 0.7 for every possible soil type we assign a new class “indifferent” because the model only makes unspecific classification there. Our results show a significant spatial refinement of the original soil polygons. Validation of our predictions was estimated on 1812 independent soil profiles which were collected subsequent to prediction in the field. Field validation gave an overall accuracy of 70\%. Map units, in which shallow soils were grouped together with deep soils could be separated best. Also histosols could be predicted successful. Highest error rate were found in map units, in which Gleysoils were grouped together with deep soils or Anthrosols. To check for validity of our results we open the black box random forest model by calculating the variable importance for each predictor variable and plotting response surfaces. We found good confirmations of our hypotheses, that topography has a significant influence on the spatial arrangement of soil types and that these relationships can be used for disaggregation.},

"Up to now, soil maps representing categorical soil units infinite number of map entities were the most common source of spatial soil information in environmental authorities" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=1}{Häring et al 2012:37})
\par
"A common approach in soil mapping is the aggregation of several soil types with different soil properties into one single complex soil map unit depending on the specific mapping scale on the one hand and the small scale heterogeneity of soils across the landscape on the other" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"The aim of this study is to present an approach for disaggregating complex soil map units. Even though the construction of complex map units is comprehensible from a mapper's point of view, it poses a question regarding site-specific forest management or land evaluation where aggregated soil map units may cause problems." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"Scale issues in soil science either with respect to transforming soil information tofiner scales (downscaling, disaggregation) or to coarser scales (upscaling, aggregation) have been addressed in literature" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"Soil distribution at one scale is therefore used to estimate the distribution at another scale." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"Beside some theoretical considerations for aggregation and disaggregation of soil information, McBratney (1998) proposed three approaches for disaggregation of polygon soil maps: transfer functions, fractal analysis, and pycnophylactic splines." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"In areas where no soil profiles were available and no detailed information on where in the landscape a specific soil type of a complex map unit is located, several studies proposed clustering methods for spatial predictions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"Bui and Moran (2001) use k-means clustering to classify soils with Landsat MSS bands, slope position and relief as predictor variables." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"However, in cases where representative soil profiles as training data were available, supervised classification is an alternative method for spatial prediction." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"The benefit from supervised classification is its ability to estimate prediction accuracy and the identification of clearly described map units or subunits." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"Thereby it is possible to follow the traditional top-down approach in soil mapping to divide an existing map unit in more homogeneous sub-units and leave the former boundaries of map polygons unchanged. This is in contrast to the aforementioned studies which result in completely disaggregated soil maps." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
\emph{¿No cabe entender que los límites también deben ser refinados cuando se aumenta la escala? Aquí se insiste en dejarlos igual, en contra posición a los otros estudios. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{note on p.38})}
\par
"Even though polygons of soil maps cannot be viewed as 100\% correct, soil maps serve as a basis for several applications. We aim to disaggregate not the entire mapped area, but only complex map units. Therefore, the existing methods are not useful for our purpose." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"Moreover, regarding the number of different classes it is unfeasible to estimate one model for our entire study area" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"If the number of classes becomes very high—as in our case 104 groups of map units—one model needs to be either very complex or it is not able to discriminate between all single classes (cf. Bui and Moran, 2001; Kempen et al., 2009). Therefore, we developed an approach applying comparably simple but class-specific models for the delineation of sub-areas." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"Almost all studies in which categorical map units were disaggregated considered a smaller number of classes (i.e. less than 10 classes:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})
\par
"Because many map units do not occur on the entire map but only on small subareas a stratification of the study-area to get parsimonious models is also favorable in our case." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=2}{Häring et al 2012:38})

"We derived a set of 23 terrain attributes. Besides classical local terrain attributes calculated with a 3×3 moving window (e.g. slope gradient, curvatures), we derived complex secondary terrain attributes (Pike et al., 2009; Wilson and Gallant, 2000). In addition, we used different window sizes (8×8, 15×15) to analyze the effect of scales and spatial context (Grinand et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2006)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=4}{Häring et al 2012:40})

\par
"Numerous studies in soil landscape modeling and digital soil mapping used topographic attributes as spatial covariates (see for an overview Behrens et al., 2010; Deumlich et al., 2010; McBratney et al., 2003; Möller et al., 2008)."

"We hypothesize that it is possible to separate different soil types within a complex map unit by quantifying the functional relationship between soil type and topography by means of statistical modeling." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=4}{Häring et al 2012:40})
\par
"We expect that we can derive a specific topographicfingerprint for each soil type by investigating the distributions of several topographic attributes for different soil types respectively." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=4}{Häring et al 2012:40})
\par
"The plots show significant differences in the appearance of these soil types on topographic gradients. These differences can be used for classification by decision tree-based classification models." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"For example a map unit containing different cambisols developed on tertiary marl or sandstones or a map unit containing calcaric and dystric Gleysols is much more influenced by geology than by topography. Different geologic conditions may also be reflected by topography, but not at all times." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})

"Classification of our soil types was performed with random forest (Breiman, 2001). Random forest is an ensemble method in which many different classification trees are combined to produce a more stable and accurate classification compared to a single decision tree (Bauer and Kohavi, 1999; Breiman, 1996; Dietterich, 2000). Each tree is built on a bootstrap sample of the given data. To form the ensemble, the different trees are combined using bagging (bootstrap aggregating). The resulting "forest" is a "random" forest because at each split only a random subset of the candidate predictors is considered for the binary partition (Elith and Graham, 2009). This de-correlates the trees, improves the variance reduction andfinally leads to more accurate predictions (Bühlmann and Yu, 2002; Strobl et al., 2009). The predictions of each single tree are combined using a majority vote to get afinal ensemble prediction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"Widely used decision trees like Breiman et al.'s CART (1984) or Quinlan's C5 (http://www.rulequest.com/, 1993) were built on recursive partitioning and impurity reduction. Entropy measures, like the Gini Index or the Shannon Index, are used to quantify the impurity in each node (Hastie et al., 2009; Strobl et al., 2009)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"When working with environmental data and in particular topographical data as covariates for statistical modeling, we always have to concern multicollinearity (Graham, 2003; Hengl and MacMillan, 2009). Strobl et al. (2007, 2008) showed that CART-based random forest implementations (like the R-package randomForest, Liaw and Wiener, 2002) are biased when predictor variables are correlated or measured on" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"Therefore, we used a random forest implementation applying conditional inference trees as base learners, which has been proven to be unbiased (Hothorn et al., 2006; Strobl et al., 2010)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"Such a framework is implemented with the functions ctree() and cforest() in the package party in R (Hothorn et al., 2006; Müller et al., 2009; R Development Core Team, 2010)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"The predictions are made on a majority vote using the predicted probabilities for the present soil types, i.e. the class with the highest probability is assigned" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"Validation of the random forest models was performed using the out-of-bag error. The predictive performance of the model is calculated on those observations which were not included in the learning sample for a specific decision tree" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"In order to detect the dependencies between predictor and dependent variables and to select the relevant predictors, one can calculate variable importance measures." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"The extraction of important predictors is calculated on the permutation accuracy importance measure. This measure is estimated by randomly permuting the values of a particular variable. By comparing the prediction accuracy before and after permuting a variable we get a measure of variable importance" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"For plausibility check in this study we use the permutation importance in the party package because it is a reliable measure even in cases with correlated predictors (Strobl et al., 2010)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"Since there are some soil types in our profile database which were very frequent (such as Cambisols, Gleysols, or Luvisols) and others that are rather scarce (e.g. Histosols or soil types with stagnic properties), we often had the problem of extremely unbalanced datasets for modeling. So at least one of the soil types constituted only a very small minority of the data which may cause a limited classification performance (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"Therefore, we implemented an if-then condition in our modeling framework: if the number of observations for one soil type in our database is greater than a proportion of 2:1 to the number of profiles of the other soil type in the grouped map unit, then we take a random sample of the former to enforce a proportion of 2:1." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=5}{Häring et al 2012:41})
\par
"Even though the overall model performance calculated on the entire data for the unbalanced dataset is better than for the reduced dataset, the problem lies in the ability of the model to discriminate between the two soil types. The evaluation of the different classes separately is performed with true positive measure (TP)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=6}{Häring et al 2012:42})
\par
"Subsequent to modeling, soil experts described augered soil profiles on defined locations. The distribution of sampling locations followed a stratified random sampling design." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=7}{Häring et al 2012:43})
\par
"First, the study area was subdivided based on an official physiographic classification of Bavaria (Wittmann, 1991). Within these areas, sampling locations were randomly distributed over the entire predicted area. In sum we got 1820 validation points." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=7}{Häring et al 2012:43})
\par
"We calculated 500 trees in every random forest model (the "ntree" argument in cforest). Random forest models with 1000 trees did not improve the performance (results not shown). The models were stable mostly with less than 200 trees. The number of randomly selected variables as candidates at each split (the "mtry" argument in cforest) was three as recommended by Hastie et al. (2009) (mtry=square root of number of predictor variable)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=7}{Häring et al 2012:43})
\par
"The statistical validation of the models based on the out-of-bag error showed misclassification rates ranging from 0.09 to 0.55 with a median of 0.31. Compared to other digital-soil-class-mapping studies this are quite good results" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U9PDW3VK?page=7}{Häring et al 2012:43})

  abstract = {Methods: We used topographic, climatic and edaphic variables to model the mean soil moisture value as found on 1505 forest plots from the database WINALPecobase. All predictor variables were taken from area-wide geodata layers so that the model can be applied to some 250 000 ha of forest in the target region. We adopted methods developed in species distribution modelling to regionalize Ellenberg indicator values. Therefore, we use the additive georegression framework for spatial prediction of Ellenberg values with the R-library mboost, which is a feasible way to consider environmental effects, spatial autocorrelation, predictor interactions and non-stationarity simultaneously in our data. The framework is much more flexible than established statistical and machine-learning models in species distribution modelling. We estimated five different mboost models reflecting different model structures on 50 bootstrap samples in each case.
Results: Median R2 values calculated on independent test samples ranged from 0.28 to 0.45. Our results show a significant influence of interactions and nonstationarity in addition to environmental covariates. Unweighted mean indicator values can be modelled better than abundance-weighted values, and the consideration of bryophytes did not improve model performance. Partial response curves indicate meaningful dependencies between moisture indicator values and environmental covariates. However, mean indicator values {$<$}4.5 and {$>$}6.0 could not be modelled correctly, since they were poorly represented in our calibration sample. The final map represents high-resolution information of site hydrological conditions.
Conclusions: Indicator values offer an effect-oriented alternative to physicallybased hydrological models to predict water-related site conditions, even at landscape scale. The presented approach is applicable to all kinds of Ellenberg indicator values. Therefore, it is a significant step towards a new generation of models of forest site types and potential natural vegetation.},

  abstract = {The development of irrigated cropping is an important component of the strategy to intensify land use in sparsely populated northern Australia. An integrated resource assessment study has been conducted, with the aim of evaluating the potential for irrigated cropping in the Flinders and Gilbert river catchments – an area of 155,500 km2 in north Queensland. The coupling of digitally derived soil and land attributes with a conventional land suitability framework facilitated the rapid evaluation of regional-scale agricultural potential in this remote area. Approximately 50\% of the total area was found to be suitable for a range of irrigated crops, but the vast majority of this area has significant soil limitations and other constraints to production. Growing crops successfully in the dry tropics of northern Australia remains a challenge. Quantified uncertainty associated with the digital soil mapping outputs was used to estimate the reliability of the land suitability assessments.},

  abstract = {Outlier detection is often a key task in a statistical analysis and helps guard against poor decision-making based on results that have been influenced by anomalous observations. For multivariate data sets, large Mahalanobis distances in raw data space or large Mahalanobis distances in principal components analysis, transformed data space, are routinely used to detect outliers. Detection in principal components analysis space can also utilise goodness of fit distances. For spatial applications, however, these global forms can only detect outliers in a non-spatial manner. This can result in false positive detections, such as when an observation’s spatial neighbours are similar, or false negative detections such as when its spatial neighbours are dissimilar. To avoid mis-classifications, we demonstrate that a local adaptation of various global methods can be used to detect multivariate spatial outliers. In particular, we account for local spatial effects via the use of geographically weighted data with either Mahalanobis distances or principal components analysis. Detection performance is assessed using simulated data as well as freshwater chemistry data collected over all of Great Britain. Results clearly show value in both geographically weighted methods to outlier detection.},

  abstract = {Digital soil morphometrics is defined as the application of tools and techniques for measuring and quantifying soil profile attributes and deriving continuous depth functions. This paper reviews how proximal soil sensing and other tools can be used in soil profile descriptions where techniques and toolkits have not changed in the past decades. The application of such tools is compared to standard soil profile descriptions for 11 common attributes: horizons, texture, color, structure, moisture, mottles, consistence, carbonates, rock fragments, pores and roots. These attributes are extensively used in soil classification and are indicative of many soil functions. There has been progress in distinguishing soil horizons, texture and soil color, mainly using vis–NIR, GPR and electrical resistivity. There is potential for in situ digital morphometrics for all attributes of a soil profile. Smaller depth increments can be sampled and analyzed, and that gives continuous depth functions of soil properties. The combined use of in situ digital morphometrics and continuous depth functions of soil properties may enhance our pedological understanding. It will take time before the toolbox of the field pedologists will be digitally enriched, but we think that digital soil morphometrics has the potential to complement existing description and analytical methods. It may yield new insights in soil horizonation, how soils form and how they could be classified.},

  abstract = {The paper evaluates spreading of observations in feature and geographical spaces as a key to sampling optimisation for spatial prediction by correlation with auxiliary maps. Although auxiliary data are commonly used for mapping soil variables, problems associated with the design of sampling strategies are rarely examined. When generalised least-squares estimation is used, the overall prediction error depends upon spreading of points in both feature and geographical space. Allocation of points uniformly over the feature space range proportionally to the distribution of predictor (equal range stratification, or ER design) is suggested as a prudent sampling strategy when the regression model between the soil and auxiliary variables is unknown. An existing 100-observation sample from a 50 by 50 km soil survey in central Croatia was used to illustrate these concepts. It was re-sampled to 25-point datasets using different experimental designs: ER and 2 response surface designs. The designs were compared for their performance in predicting soil organic matter from elevation (univariate example) using the overall prediction error as an evaluation criterion. The ER design gave overall prediction error similar to the minmax design, suggesting that it is a good compromise between accurate model estimation and minimisation of spatial autocorrelation of residuals. In addition, the ER design was extended to the multivariate case. Four predictors (elevation, temperature, wetness index, and NDVI) were transformed to standardised principal components. The sampling points were then assigned to the components in proportion to the variance explained by a principal component analysis and following the ER design. Since stratification of the feature space results in a large number of possible points in each cluster, the spreading in geographical space can also be maximised by selecting the best of several realisations.},

  abstract = {A method to enhance manual landform delineation using photointerpretation to map a larger area is described. Conventional aerial photo-interpretation (API) maps using a geo-pedological legend of 21 classes were prepared for six sample areas totaling 111 km2 in the Baranja region, eastern Croatia. Nine terrain parameters extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) (ground water depth, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, viewshed, accumulation flow, wetness index, sediment transport index, and the distance to nearest watercourse) were used to extrapolate photo-interpretation over the entire survey area (1062 km2). The classification accuracy was assessed using the error matrix, calculated by comparing both the whole API maps and point samples, with the results of classification. The first results, using a maximum-likelihood classifier, were 58.2\% (hill land), 39.1\% (plain), and 45.3\% (entire area) reproducibility of the training set. Six classes in the plain were responsible for a large proportion of the misclassifications, due to an insufficiently detailed DEM and the complex nature of landforms (point bar complexes, levees, active channel banks), which cannot be explained with the terrain parameters only. Reproducibility for a simplified legend of 15 classes over the study area was improved to 65.8\% (plain), 58.2\% (hill land), and 63.4\% (entire area) using the whole-API training set. After the simplification of legend (15) and with the iterative (3) selection of pointsample training set, classification was able to reproduce 97.6\% (hill land), 86.7\% (plain), and 90.2\% (entire area) of the training set. The supervised classification showed fine details not achieved by photointerpretation. The number of manual photo-interpretations that had to be prepared was reduced from 84 to 6. The methodology can be applied by soil survey teams to edit and update current maps and to enhance or replace API for new surveys.},

\par
"Both CTI and STI were calculated in ILWIS using the multiple flow direction method of Quinn et al. (1991).

"During the creation of the predictors, it became clear that there were major differences in central values and spread of terrain parameters (as seen on histograms)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=4}{Hengl et al 2003:1813})
\par
"Some predictors (SLOPE, VSHED, CTI) showed asymetrical, log-normal, while others (GWD, STI, and DISTW) inverse distributions. This asymmetry in histograms reflects with a low contrast in images due to the domination of the plain landforms. In addition, there was a significant inter-predictor correlation between the two major landscapes (hill land and plain) (Table 2). Especially PROFC and TANGC are inversely related, as are CTI and SLOPE, while the strongest correlation show STI and SLOPE. Similarly, higher elevations are associated with steeper slopes and lower CTI." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=4}{Hengl et al 2003:1813})

"Because of these correlations and the difference in spread among predictors, we assumed that the data reduction by factor analysis in a GIS (Eastman and Fulk, 1993) would be an effective transformation to reduce multicollinearity and improve the contrast in predictors."

"The landform maps were then ready to be used in an image processing software (ILWIS) as "synthetic bands," that is, to classify the whole area as in the case of classification of remote sensing images (Janssen and Huurneman, 2001)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=5}{Hengl et al 2003:1814})
\par
"Two methods for selecting training samples were compared. In the first, the entire area of the interpreted photographs, that is, API maps (in further text whole-API training set). In the second, training samples were created by manual selection on-screen of about 100 pixels within each photo-interpretation unit in the sample areas (in further text point-sample training set)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=5}{Hengl et al 2003:1814})
\par
"In addition, the photointerpretation units were displayed as boundaries over falsecolor composites of synthetic bands and then point-samples checked to ensure that they fall in relatively homogenous facets" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=5}{Hengl et al 2003:1814})
\par
"In photo-interpretation, a three-dimensional model is constructed in the analyst's visual perception by comparing adjacent photos of a stereopair, whereas in on-screen interpretation, a color composite is adjusted by the analyst until key geomorphic differences are evident by color alone." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=5}{Hengl et al 2003:1814})
\par
"The training samples were then used as input to maximum likelihood classifiers (Lillesand and Kiefer, 2000, Section 7.9), with no distance thresholds, so that all pixels were classified. Automated (classification) and manual (photo) API maps were compared over the entire training area with a confusion matrix, with two test criteria: (i) the proportion of agreement between the two classifications, and (ii) the kappa coefficient, which accounts for chance agreement (Congalton and Green, 1999)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=5}{Hengl et al 2003:1814})
\par
"Thus the second method allows more precision, as the photo-interpretation units typically have inclusions within their minimum legible delineation that may confuse the classifier. This subjective process is an extension of subjective photo-interpretation:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=5}{Hengl et al 2003:1814})
\par
"Finally, because of the low data redundancy in this data set, there was little advantage in working further with principal components, so we concentrated on the original terrain parameters instead." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=6}{Hengl et al 2003:1815})
\par
"The whole-API set was consistently superior to the point-sample set, and classification of separate landscapes was superior to a single classification, but in no case was the classification accuracy satisfactory (80\%)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=7}{Hengl et al 2003:1816})
\par
"This shows that the complex landform facets cannot be easily distinguished by using the terrain parameters. The overall poor results can be attributed to poor separation in feature space, especially in plain region. Since these classes occupied a small proportion of the training areas, they were eliminated from the legend. Similar considerations applied to Pl112 (levee), Pl122 (active channel banks), and Pl213 (small elevations on the low terrace). Together these classes occupied only 3.5\% of the training API in the study area (4.7\% of the plain)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=8}{Hengl et al 2003:1817})
\par
"For the whole-API training set, we assigned the photointerpretation areas for the eliminated classes to the geomorphologically most similar class of the reduced legend, which turned out to always be adjacent to the merged class in geographical space." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=8}{Hengl et al 2003:1817})
\par
"We then repeated the classification with the wholeAPI training set, resulting in overall accuracies relative to the API of 63.4\% (whole area), 65.8\% (plain), and 58.2\% (hill land), that is, an improvement of 26.7\% in the plain and 18.1\% overall; the results for the hill land were not affected. These results show that whole-API set is unlikely to produce satisfactory results, due to the unavoidable heterogeneity within an API unit and consequent overlap in feature space." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=8}{Hengl et al 2003:1817})
\par
"This shows that the API polygons are indeed heterogeneous, and their internal variability is best represented by all pixels in the map unit." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=8}{Hengl et al 2003:1817})

"An interesting question with a hierarchical legend is to what degree are the higher levels operational. In this case, to what degree are the misclassifications at detailed level within the same higher-level category." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=10}{Hengl et al 2003:1819})
\par
"At the highest level (landscape), the automatic classifier using selected points and a reduced legend was quite good. Almost all pixels of the training sample (98.6\%) were classified in the correct landscape." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=10}{Hengl et al 2003:1819})

"To survey all of Baranja with the conventional method of semi-detailed soil survey based on landscape analysis would have required the manual interpretation of the center photos of 84 photo-triplets. In the present study, we used only six photos (6.25\% of the total) to map the whole area and therefore largely decreased cost and effort." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=10}{Hengl et al 2003:1819})

"A further step would be to do field sampling of the soils in these units to determine if they are distinct soil-landscape units." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=10}{Hengl et al 2003:1819})
\par
"Supervised classification can be applied over entire survey areas, or separately in major landscapes through easily identified master lines, which tend to follow slope breaks or abrupt changes of landscape type." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=10}{Hengl et al 2003:1819})
\par
"In the current study, the results improved only slightly. However, stratification has the conceptual advantage that the predictive equations correspond better to conventional understanding of soil formation in different environments. Stratification of the area also enables selection of different predictor sets for each landscape. On the other hand, it is more practical to develop a single data set and predictive map of the entire area at once." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=10}{Hengl et al 2003:1819})
\par
"The likely reasons for poor performance in the plain are: (i) the limited vertical resolution of the DEM relative to the relief, (ii) large distances between known elevations (contour lines), both of these leading to artifacts in the landform parameterization, (iii) the absence of predictor variables specifically adapted to the plain, other than relative elevation, such as distance to local drainage, and (iv) the presence of landform complexes which occupy too much of feature space" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=10}{Hengl et al 2003:1819})
\par
"Considering the classification accuracy, the supervised landform classification provides, in general, poorer results than the typical accuracy of land-cover classification." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=11}{Hengl et al 2003:1820})
\par
"The following three steps refinements may be applied, by preference in the order given: (i) refine the training set for classes that are misclassified, using scatter diagrams in feature space; (ii) simplify the legend or eliminate or merge classes; (iii) adjust the number of sample points for misclassified classes; and (iv) consider addition of different predictors or improvement of the quality of existing ones."

\par
"This is in contrarily to the unsupervised classification of landforms as described by Burrough et al. (2000), where the only input needed is the number of classes and fuzzy exponent. In the case of supervised classification, the analyst must still have a good knowledge of soil-landform relations, whether working with traditional or GIS-assisted methods."

"The supervised landform classification and visualization of terrain parameters as color-composites has two major advantages that can be used to enhance API for Soil Survey." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=12}{Hengl et al 2003:1821})
\par
"First, the use of terrain parameters provides an objective and cost-effective basis for clustering of landscape facets." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=12}{Hengl et al 2003:1821})
\par
"The classification also identified soil-landscape units smaller than the minimum legible delineation. If these are not just artifacts of the landform classification, this implies that semi-detailed survey could result in maps detailed enough for site-specific management." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=12}{Hengl et al 2003:1821})
\par
"Second potential application of the proposed methods is to edit the soil boundaries of existing soil maps and improve their spatial accuracy within an existing GIS." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=12}{Hengl et al 2003:1821})
\par
"This can be done by simply overlying the given boundaries over the false color-composites of terrain parameters or the results of a supervised classification and then modifying the boundaries to match changes in the terrain parameters." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRRS34W?page=12}{Hengl et al 2003:1821})
\par
"The mapping project is thus the result of collaboration between an expert mapper and the GIS, able to find patterns with correct training. Far from eliminating soil surveyors, this process allows them to concentrate their efforts on their area of expertise, for example, identification of soil-landscape relations, and map large areas as efficiently as possible."

  abstract = {Quality of digital elevation models (DEMs) and DEM-derived products directly affects the quality of terrain analysis applications. The objective of this work was to review and systematise methods to improve geomorphic plausibility of DEMs and minimise artefacts and outliers in terrain parameters. Three approaches to the reduction of errors in DEM and DEM-derived products are described: (a) by using empirical knowledge, e.g. to adjust elevations using medial axes or stream networks; (b) by applying filtering operations and (c) by averaging terrain parameters derived from multiple realisations of DEM, i.e. using error propagation technique. The methods were tested using a 3.8×3.8 km sample area covering two distinct landscapes: hilland and plain with terraces. The DEM was produced by linear interpolation of contour data. The proportion of artefacts (padi terraces) in the unfiltered DEM was 17.3\%. After the addition of medial axes, filtering of outliers and adjustment of elevation for streams, the proportion of padi terraces was reduced to 2.2\%. Remaining errors in terrain parameters such as undefined pixels and local outliers were reduced using repeated filtering (with iterations). All terrain parameters were also calculated by averaging multiple realisations. Both the filtering approach and averaging multiple realisations give somewhat smoother maps of terrain parameters. The advantage of filtering of outliers is that it employs the spatial autocorrelation structure. The advantage of averaging multiple realisations is that it can be easier automated. The reduction of errors improved the mapping of landform facets (classification) and solum thickness (regression). The classification accuracy increased from 51.3 to 72\% and the R2 of the regression model for the prediction of the solum thickness increased from 0.27 to 0.40. These methods can be used to filter DEMs derived from contour data and terrain parameters, but also to reduce errors in other types of gridded DEMs and DEM-derived products. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper discusses empirical and analytical rules to select a suitable grid resolution for output maps and based on the inherent properties of the input data. The choice of grid resolution was related with the cartographic and statistical concepts: scale, computer processing power, positional accuracy, size of delineations, inspection density, spatial autocorrelation structure and complexity of terrain. These were further related with the concepts from the general statistics and information theory such as Nyquist frequency concept from signal processing and equations to estimate the probability density function. Selection of grid resolution was demonstrated using four datasets: (1) GPS positioning data—the grid resolution was related to the area of circle described by the error radius, (2) map of agricultural plots—the grid resolution was related to the size of smallest and narrowest plots, (3) point dataset from soil mapping—the grid resolution was related to the inspection density, nugget variation and range of spatial autocorrelation and (4) contour map used for production of digital elevation model—the grid resolution was related with the spacing between the contour lines i.e. complexity of terrain. It was concluded that no ideal grid resolution exists, but rather a range of suitable resolutions. One should at least try to avoid using resolutions that do not comply with the effective scale or inherent properties of the input dataset. Three standard grid resolutions for output maps were finally recommended: (a) the coarsest legible grid resolution—this is the largest resolution that we should use in order to respect the scale of work and properties of a dataset; (b) the finest legible grid resolution—this is the smallest grid resolution that represents 95\% of spatial objects or topography; and (c) recommended grid resolution—a compromise between the two. Objective procedures to derive the true optimal grid resolution that maximizes the predictive capabilities or information content of a map are further discussed. This methodology can now be integrated within a GIS package to help inexperienced users select a suitable grid resolution without doing extensive data preprocessing.},

"For example, in traditional soil cartography the scale of an existing map is commonly assessed by estimating either the maximum location accuracy (MLA) or average size area (ASA) of the polygons on the ground (Rossiter, 2003).

"The grid resolution can also be related to the MLA, which commonly ranges from 0.25 mm to maximum of 0.1 mm on the map (Vink, 1975). This gives the smallest legible resolutions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=4}{Hengl 2006:1286})

"McBratney et al. (2003, Table 1), suggested that there should be at least 2 2 pixels to represent smallest rounded objects of interest and at least two pixels to represent the width of elongated objects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=4}{Hengl 2006:1286})
\par
"The grid resolution can also be related with the size of area and processing power of our computer. Although we might insist on using the finest grid resolution possible, the calculation time will increase exponentially (cubically) with the total number of pixels in a map (McBratney, 1998)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=4}{Hengl 2006:1286})
\par
"the choice of the grid resolution can be related with the positional accuracy of our field positioning method. This is especially important for integration of GPS with remote sensing images and aerial photos where we should be certain that our GPS reading will (most probably) fall inside the right pixel" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=5}{Hengl 2006:1287})
\par
"To ensure this, we first need to estimate the confidence radius of the positioning method using some control points. The confidence radius is the radius of a circle where we expect the mostðP¼ 95\%Þ of the points to appear (Arnaud and Flori, 1998)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=5}{Hengl 2006:1287})
\par
"We can do that by inspecting the size of smallest spatial objects that are being mapped and then select the appropriate grid resolution, i.e. remote imaging system." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=6}{Hengl 2006:1288})
\par
"Again, there should be at least four pixels to represent smallest objects and at least two pixels to represent the narrowest objects," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=6}{Hengl 2006:1288})
\par
"where P is the perimeter of polygon, a is the area of polygon and r is the radius of circle with the same surface area (Hole, 1953). Arbitrary value of 3 is used to differentiate between compact and narrow/ long polygons." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=6}{Hengl 2006:1288})
\par
"For example, if the objective of our mapping project are agricultural plots, and if the smallest plots are about 1 ha, the grid resolution should be at least 50 m," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=6}{Hengl 2006:1288})
\par
"If the smallest plots are about 0.05 ha (corresponds to the scale 1:5000), we will need images with resolutions of 10 m and finer." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=6}{Hengl 2006:1288})
\par
"Obviously, the denser the observation points, the larger the scale of mapping. A cartographic rule, used for example in soil mapping, is that there should be at least one (ideally four) observation per 1 cm2 of the map (Avery, 1987, Table 1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=7}{Hengl 2006:1289})
\par
"If we are dealing with random point samples, then the average spacing between the closest point pairs is approximately half the spacing between closest point pairs in regular point samples" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=7}{Hengl 2006:1289})
\par
"In addition, we can inspect the spatial correlation structure of the point data set and use this information to select the grid resolution" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=8}{Hengl 2006:1290})
\par
"Here the key is to estimate the range of spatial dependence. Obviously, a variable that is spatially auto-correlated at shorter distances would require finer grid resolution and vice versa." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=8}{Hengl 2006:1290})
\par
"The key problem when selecting a grid resolution for terrain analysis is that there can be a significant difference between the surface elevation on a coarser grid versus the actual topography, meaning that some peaks and channels might disappear in a raster DEM" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=9}{Hengl 2006:1291})
\par
"Even more so, if the grid resolution is too fine it might introduce local artefacts or slow down computation of terrain parameters." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=9}{Hengl 2006:1291})
\par
"Hence, the grid resolution should be at least half the average spacing between the inflection points:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=9}{Hengl 2006:1291})
\par
"There are three important concepts brought out in this paper that need to be further emphasized." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=13}{Hengl 2006:1295})
\par
"Coarsest legible grid resolution—this is the largest resolution that we should use given a specific scale, positional accuracy, size of objects or/and complexity of terrain." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=13}{Hengl 2006:1295})
\par
"Finest legible grid resolution—this is the smallest grid resolution that represents the most (95\%) of spatial objects or topography. This is the finest meaningful resolution which corresponds to the concept of the maximum location accuracy" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=14}{Hengl 2006:1296})
\par
"Recommended grid resolution—this is a compromising resolution, usually set as the intermediate number between the coarsest and finest resolutions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=14}{Hengl 2006:1296})
\par
"For example, if we wish to use terrain parameters to predict soil properties over entire study area, we can test terrain parameters derived at various resolutions and then select the one that offers the highest correlation coefficient with the target variable (Florinsky and Kuryakova, 2000)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IJMWEML8?page=14}{Hengl 2006:1296})

  abstract = {The paper compares semi-automated interpolation methods to produce soil-class maps from profile observations and by using multiple auxiliary predictors such as terrain parameters, remote sensing indices and similar. The Soil Profile Database of Iran, consisting of 4250 profiles, was used to test different soil-class interpolators. The target variables were soil texture classes and World Reference Base soil groups. The predictors were 6 terrain parameters, 11 MODIS EVI images and 17 physiographic regions (polygon map) of Iran. Four techniques were considered: (a) supervised classification using maximum likelihoods; (b) multinominal logistic regression; (c) regression-kriging on memberships; and (d) classification of taxonomic distances. The predictive capabilities were assessed using a control subset of 30\% profiles and the kappa statistics as criterion. Supervised classification and multinominal logistic regression can lead to poor results if soil-classes overlap in the feature space, or if the correlation between the soil-classes and predictors is low. The two other methods have better predictive capabilities, although both are computationally more demanding. For both mapping of texture classes and soil types, the best prediction was achieved using regressionkriging of indicators/memberships (κ = 45\%, κ = 54\%). In all cases kappa was smaller than 60\%, which can be explained by the preferential sampling plan, the poor definition of soil-classes and the high variability of soils. Steps to improve interpolation of soil-class data, by taking into account the fuzziness of classes directly on the field are further discussed.},

"Geomorphometry is the science of quantitative land-surface analysis (Pike, 1995, 2000a; Rasemann et al., 2004). It is a modern, analytical-cartographic approach to representing bare-earth topography by the computer manipulation of terrain height (Tobler, 1976, 2000)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=27}{Hengl et al 2009:27})
\par
"It is well to keep in mind the two overarching modes of geomorphometric analysis first distinguished by Evans (1972): specific, addressing discrete surface features (i.e. landforms), and general, treating the continuous land surface." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=27}{Hengl et al 2009:27})
\par
"The morphometry of landforms per se, by or without the use of digital data, is more correctly considered part of quantitative geomorphology" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=27}{Hengl et al 2009:27})
\par
"Geomorphometry in this book is primarily the computer characterisation and analysis of continuous topography." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=27}{Hengl et al 2009:27})
\par
"Quantitative descriptors, or measures, of land-surface form have been referred to as topographic attributes or properties (Wilson and Gallant, 2000)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=28}{Hengl et al 2009:28})

\par
"The much used terrain analysis (Moore et al., 1991a; Wilson and Gallant, 2000) is confusing (unless preceded by quantitative), because it has long denoted qualitative (manual) stereoscopic photoor image-interpretation (Way, 1973)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=28}{Hengl et al 2009:28})
\par
"To minimise confusion, the authors of this book have agreed to consistently use geomorphometry to denote the scientific discipline and land surface6 to indicate the principal object of study." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})
\par
"Digital representation of the land surface thus will be referred to as a digital land surface model (DLSM), a specific type of digital surface model (DSM) that is more or less equivalent to the widely-accepted term digital elevation model7 (DEM)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})
\par
"Digital elevation model (DEM) has become the favoured term for the data most commonly input to geomorphometry, ever since the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) first began distribution of 3-arc-second DEMs in 1974 (Allder et al., 1982)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})

"The usual input to geomorphometric analysis is a square-grid representation of the land surface: a digital elevation (or land surface) model (DEM or DLSM)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})
\par
""DEM" implies that elevation is available continuously at each grid location, at a given resolution" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})
\par
"A landsurface parameter8 is a descriptive measure of surface form (e.g. slope, aspect, wetness index); it is arrayed in a continuous field of values, usually as a raster image or map, for the same referent area as its source DEM." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=30}{Hengl et al 2009:30})
\par
"A land-surface object9 is a discrete spatial feature (e.g. watershed line, cirque, alluvial fan, drainage network), best represented on a vector map consisting of points, lines, and/or polygons extracted from the square-grid DEM." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=30}{Hengl et al 2009:30})
\par
"It is also important to distinguish parameters per se, which describe the land surface at a point or local sample area, from quantitative attributes that describe objects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=30}{Hengl et al 2009:30})

\par
"Basic parameters and objects describe local morphology of the land surface (e.g. slope gradient, aspect and curvature). Hydrological or flow-accumulation parameters and objects reflect potential movement of material over the land surface (e.g. indices of erosion or mass movement). The third group of parameters and objects is often calculated by adjusting climatic or meteorological quantities to the influence of surface relief."

"Each landform may be composed of several landform elements, smaller divisions of the land surface that have relatively constant morphometric properties." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=31}{Hengl et al 2009:31})
\par
"A landform element is a division of the land surface, at a given scale or spatial resolution, bounded by topographic discontinuities and having (relatively) uniform morphometry." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=31}{Hengl et al 2009:31})
\par
"Recognition of landforms and less exactly defined tracts, commonly referred to as land-surface types, from the analysis of DEMs is increasingly important." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=32}{Hengl et al 2009:32})
\par
"In the special case of landforms extracted as "memberships" by a fuzzy classification algorithm, such forms can be considered to "partake" of a particular land-surface object — instead of directly mapping, say, a stream channel, we can obtain a "membership value"10 to that landform." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=32}{Hengl et al 2009:32})
\par
"The principal advantage of a raster GIS over other spatial data structures is that a single measure — the cell or pixel size — automatically controls most technical properties." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=33}{Hengl et al 2009:33})
\par
"ecause most land-surface parameters vary with spatial scale, or an be calculated by different algorithms and sampling grids, no map computed om a DEM is definitive." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=35}{Hengl et al 2009:35})
\par
"Adjustments such as these differ among software packages, so that almost always some small differences will be found in outputs from exactly the same mathematical formulas." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=36}{Hengl et al 2009:36})

\par
"The concept of the elevation contour to describe topography dates to 1584 when the Dutch surveyor Pieter Bruinz drew lines of equal depth in the River Spaarne; but this was an unpublished manuscript (Imhof, 1982)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=37}{Hengl et al 2009:37})
\par
"This has proved very effective in representing topography and is one of the most important innovations in the history of mapping by virtue of its convenience, exactness, and ease of perception (Robinson, 1982)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=37}{Hengl et al 2009:37})

\par
"It is when we add the effect of the gravitational field to the purely geometrical ideas of local analysis that differential geometry really turns into geomorphometry." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=163}{Hengl et al 2009:163})

"The single flow direction approach has the disadvantage that it discretises the flow into only one of eight possible directions. Therefore it produces artificial straight-line patterns especially in areas of flat terrain and on convex landforms with dispersed water flow. SFD is useful for stream network extraction where a single cell representation is needed. Multiple flow routing has the disadvantage that the flow from a cell is dispersed to all neighbours of lower elevation, resulting in a more diffuse flow of water, especially in valleys where concentrated water flow occurs."

However, when these land-surface parameters are combined in one model, the predictive value can be significantly improved. An example of this can be an area with relatively small slope steepness and big catchment area. When these two factors coincide under humid climate wetland can be formed. Only the combined effect of the two factors can explain the occurrence of the hydromorphic soils on the area. Such complex nature of relief as a soil forming factor can be quite difficult to represent by using simple linear models."

"It can be concluded, that large scale studies using high resolution DEM (up to 20 m cell size) will focus on land-surface parameters representing actual, sitespecific measures of terrain, like, slope, catchment area, TWI, etc. Low resolution DEM used for small scale studies does not represent the actual values of the land-surface parameters, only the overall average values.

"Geomorphometry is the science of quantitative land-surface analysis (Pike, 1995, 2000a; Rasemann et al., 2004). It is a modern, analytical-cartographic approach to representing bare-earth topography by the computer manipulation of terrain height (Tobler, 1976, 2000)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=27}{Hengl et al 2009:27})
\par
"It is well to keep in mind the two overarching modes of geomorphometric analysis first distinguished by Evans (1972): specific, addressing discrete surface features (i.e. landforms), and general, treating the continuous land surface." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=27}{Hengl et al 2009:27})
\par
"The morphometry of landforms per se, by or without the use of digital data, is more correctly considered part of quantitative geomorphology" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=27}{Hengl et al 2009:27})
\par
"Geomorphometry in this book is primarily the computer characterisation and analysis of continuous topography." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=27}{Hengl et al 2009:27})
\par
"Quantitative descriptors, or measures, of land-surface form have been referred to as topographic attributes or properties (Wilson and Gallant, 2000)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=28}{Hengl et al 2009:28})
\par
"terrain attributes (Pennock, 2003)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=28}{Hengl et al 2009:28})
\par
"The much used terrain analysis (Moore et al., 1991a; Wilson and Gallant, 2000) is confusing (unless preceded by quantitative), because it has long denoted qualitative (manual) stereoscopic photoor image-interpretation (Way, 1973)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=28}{Hengl et al 2009:28})
\par
"To minimise confusion, the authors of this book have agreed to consistently use geomorphometry to denote the scientific discipline and land surface6 to indicate the principal object of study." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})
\par
"Digital representation of the land surface thus will be referred to as a digital land surface model (DLSM), a specific type of digital surface model (DSM) that is more or less equivalent to the widely-accepted term digital elevation model7 (DEM)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})
\par
"Digital elevation model (DEM) has become the favoured term for the data most commonly input to geomorphometry, ever since the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) first began distribution of 3-arc-second DEMs in 1974 (Allder et al., 1982)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})
\par
"The usual input to geomorphometric analysis is a square-grid representation of the land surface: a digital elevation (or land surface) model (DEM or DLSM)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})
\par
""DEM" implies that elevation is available continuously at each grid location, at a given resolution" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=29}{Hengl et al 2009:29})
\par
"A landsurface parameter8 is a descriptive measure of surface form (e.g. slope, aspect, wetness index); it is arrayed in a continuous field of values, usually as a raster image or map, for the same referent area as its source DEM." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=30}{Hengl et al 2009:30})
\par
"A land-surface object9 is a discrete spatial feature (e.g. watershed line, cirque, alluvial fan, drainage network), best represented on a vector map consisting of points, lines, and/or polygons extracted from the square-grid DEM." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=30}{Hengl et al 2009:30})
\par
"It is also important to distinguish parameters per se, which describe the land surface at a point or local sample area, from quantitative attributes that describe objects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=30}{Hengl et al 2009:30})
\par
"The fundamental operation in geomorphometry is extraction of parameters and objects from DEMs (Figure 2)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=30}{Hengl et al 2009:30})

Deriving land-surface parameters and objects. 5. Applications of the resulting parameters and objects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=30}{Hengl et al 2009:30})
\par
"Basic parameters and objects describe local morphology of the land surface (e.g. slope gradient, aspect and curvature). Hydrological or flow-accumulation parameters and objects reflect potential movement of material over the land surface (e.g. indices of erosion or mass movement). The third group of parameters and objects is often calculated by adjusting climatic or meteorological quantities to the influence of surface relief." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=31}{Hengl et al 2009:31})

"A special group of land-surface objects — geomorphological units, land elements and landforms —" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=31}{Hengl et al 2009:31})
\par
"Each landform may be composed of several landform elements, smaller divisions of the land surface that have relatively constant morphometric properties." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=31}{Hengl et al 2009:31})
\par
"A landform element is a division of the land surface, at a given scale or spatial resolution, bounded by topographic discontinuities and having (relatively) uniform morphometry." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=31}{Hengl et al 2009:31})
\par
"Recognition of landforms and less exactly defined tracts, commonly referred to as land-surface types, from the analysis of DEMs is increasingly important." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=32}{Hengl et al 2009:32})
\par
"In the special case of landforms extracted as "memberships" by a fuzzy classification algorithm, such forms can be considered to "partake" of a particular land-surface object — instead of directly mapping, say, a stream channel, we can obtain a "membership value"10 to that landform." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=32}{Hengl et al 2009:32})
\par
"The principal advantage of a raster GIS over other spatial data structures is that a single measure — the cell or pixel size — automatically controls most technical properties." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=33}{Hengl et al 2009:33})
\par
"ecause most land-surface parameters vary with spatial scale, or an be calculated by different algorithms and sampling grids, no map computed om a DEM is definitive." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=35}{Hengl et al 2009:35})
\par
"Adjustments such as these differ among software packages, so that almost always some small differences will be found in outputs from exactly the same mathematical formulas." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=36}{Hengl et al 2009:36})

"Geomorphometry evolved from a mix of mathematics, computer processing, civil and military engineering, and the Earth sciences — especially geomorphology." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=36}{Hengl et al 2009:36})
\par
"The concept of the elevation contour to describe topography dates to 1584 when the Dutch surveyor Pieter Bruinz drew lines of equal depth in the River Spaarne; but this was an unpublished manuscript (Imhof, 1982)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=37}{Hengl et al 2009:37})
\par
"This has proved very effective in representing topography and is one of the most important innovations in the history of mapping by virtue of its convenience, exactness, and ease of perception (Robinson, 1982)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=37}{Hengl et al 2009:37})
\par
"In 1859, Alfred Cayley published "On contour lines and slope lines", which laid out the mathematical foundation of geomorphometry." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=39}{Hengl et al 2009:39})
\par
"The drainage basin is Earth's dominant land-surface object and its analysis is, strictly speaking, a branch of specific geomorphometry." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=40}{Hengl et al 2009:40})
\par
"Particularly useful to the geomorphometrist for sorting out descriptive parameters were techniques of multiple-correlation and factor and principal-components analysis (Lewis, 1968)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=45}{Hengl et al 2009:45})
\par
"Cluster analysis proved adept at automating th identification of topographic types and delimiting land-surface regions from sam ples of land-surface parameters (Mather, 1972)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=46}{Hengl et al 2009:46})

""Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things" (Tobler, 1970)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=48}{Hengl et al 2009:48})
\par
"Recent developments include automated methods to detect landform facets by unsupervised fuzzy-set classification (Burrough et al., 2000; Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=49}{Hengl et al 2009:49})

"a number of them can be derived directly from a DEM without further knowledge of the area represented. We refer to those measures as basic land-surface parameters." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=163}{Hengl et al 2009:163})

"they represent the raw shape of the land surface, regardless of how that surface relates to formational processes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=163}{Hengl et al 2009:163})

"Some basic land-surface parameters are analysed locally" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=163}{Hengl et al 2009:163})
\par
"The regions needed for regional analysis are defined by the movement of flows downhill and the relation it establishes between cells." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=163}{Hengl et al 2009:163})
\par
"It is when we add the effect of the gravitational field to the purely geometrical ideas of local analysis that differential geometry really turns into geomorphometry." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=163}{Hengl et al 2009:163})

"Basic land-surface parameters are measures that can be derived directly from a DEM without further knowledge of the area represented. There can be local (geometric and statistical) and regional parameters." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=164}{Hengl et al 2009:164})
\par
"Geometric parameters are those based on an analysis of the geometrical properties of the land surface. This includes slope and aspect, as well as curvatures and other values derived from them." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=164}{Hengl et al 2009:164})
\par
"The first morphometric properties of a terrain than can be studied are those derived from the first partial derivatives of its surface." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=166}{Hengl et al 2009:166})
\par
"The two main geometrical properties that can be derived from the gradient are its length (modulus) and its direction. When these concepts are applied to geomorphometry, they constitute two of the most important land-surface parameters: slope and aspect." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=166}{Hengl et al 2009:166})
\par
"Slope gradient can be expressed in radians or degrees, but it is usual (and more practical in many fields) to reflect its values in \%," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=166}{Hengl et al 2009:166})

"geomorphometry can be a fruitful way of developing new parameters and gaining a better understanding of the information contained in the DEM." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=168}{Hengl et al 2009:168})
\par
"Slope gradient can also be used to derive many new parameters, such as those for soil erosion and deposition, soil wetness, flow speed, and many others." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=168}{Hengl et al 2009:168})

"An important parameter related to slope gradient is surface area" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=168}{Hengl et al 2009:168})
\par
"The real area, the one, for example, that is available to the animals living on that cell, or the one that has to be used to calculate the cost of reforesting the cell, should consider the influence of slope" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=168}{Hengl et al 2009:168})

"They then calculated and summed the areas of the portions of each triangle that lay within the cell boundary." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=168}{Hengl et al 2009:168})
\par
"Regarding aspect, its value depends on which direction is taken as the origin" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=168}{Hengl et al 2009:168})
\par
"Usually, it is measured in degrees, read clockwise from north, ranging from 0 to 360°." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=168}{Hengl et al 2009:168})
\par
"This is the basis, for the most part, of flow direction algorithms." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=169}{Hengl et al 2009:169})
\par
"Aspect is a circular land-surface parameter, i.e. m and m + 360◦ describe the same slope direction. For this reason, some authors use cos(a) as slope northerness, and sin(a) as slope easterness, especially in statistical comparisons (e.g. King et al., 1999)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=169}{Hengl et al 2009:169})
\par
"Slope gradient and aspect are the most standard local geomorphometric measures. They can be derived using various algorithms." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=169}{Hengl et al 2009:169})
\par
"Aspect can also be used to determine whether a cell should be considered sunny or not." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=169}{Hengl et al 2009:169})
\par
"The next step in the analysis of local morphometric variables is the one involving second derivatives. These are related to the concavity and convexity of the surface." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=171}{Hengl et al 2009:171})
\par
"The parameter describing this is called curvature." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=171}{Hengl et al 2009:171})
\par
"The profile (or vertical) curvature and tangential (or horizontal) curvature can be used to distinguish (locally) convex and concave shapes. Concave tangential curvature indicates convergence and convex divergence of flow lines. Convex profile curvature indicates acceleration of flow." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=172}{Hengl et al 2009:172})

"The average of the curvatures of any mutually orthogonal normal sections is mean curvature (MEANC)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=174}{Hengl et al 2009:174})
\par
"The mean curvature describes mean-concave and mean-convex terrains, which makes it especially interesting for geomorphologic studies" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=174}{Hengl et al 2009:174})
\par
"The second independent curvature is the difference curvature (DIFFC), defined as a half of a difference between vertical and horizontal curvature" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=174}{Hengl et al 2009:174})
\par
"Although the meaning of curvatures is related mostly to the behaviour of the flows that go through the cell, this indirectly alters other parameters such as, for example, those related to soil properties. Therefore, curvatures can be of great value for understanding other different characteristics of the terrain that we are analysing." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=175}{Hengl et al 2009:175})
\par
"PROFC has a significant relation with soil moisture. It indicates the tendency of water to increase its speed (when the curvature reflects a convex form) or decrease it (when it reflects a concave one), thus also indicating whether a cell is prone to accumulating water or not (Shary et al., 2002)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=175}{Hengl et al 2009:175})

"This also gives interesting information about the potential erosion that can be generated by that flow, and when combined with vertical curvature, this information can even be extended." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=175}{Hengl et al 2009:175})

"Up to this point, we have been using a fixed size for our analysis window." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=177}{Hengl et al 2009:177})

"A discussion on the convenience of using one or other window size can be found in Chapter 14, along with some examples (Figure 5 in Chapter 14)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67SBVJ45?page=177}{Hengl et al 2009:177})
\par
"However, if we do not need a mathematical definition of the DEM, and so do not need to adjust strictly to the minimum 3×3 window, then the size of the analysis window should depend on the particular characteristics and physical meaning of the land-surface parameters that we are calculating."

  abstract = {Geostatistical mapping can be defined as analytical production of maps by using field observations, auxiliary information and a computer program that calculates values at locations of interest. Today, increasingly the heart of a mapping project is, in fact, the computer program that implements some (geo)statistical algorithm to a given point data set. Purpose of this guide is to assist you in producing quality maps by using fully-operational tools, without a need for serious additional investments. It will first introduce you the to the basic principles of geostatistical mapping and regression-kriging, as the key prediction technique, then it will guide you through four software packages: ILWIS GIS, R+gstat, SAGA GIS and Google Earth, which will be used to prepare the data, run analysis and make final layouts. These materials have been used for the five-days advanced training course "Hands-on-geostatistics: merging GIS and spatial statistics", that is regularly organized by the author and collaborators. Visit the course website to obtain a copy of the datasets used in this exercise. [Résumé de l'auteur].},

  abstract = {This paper proposes two compound measures of mapping quality to support objective comparison of spatial prediction techniques for geostatistical mapping: (1) mapping efficiency – defined as the costs per area per amount of variation explained by the model, and (2) information production efficiency – defined as the cost per byte of effective information produced. These were inspired by concepts of complexity from mathematics and physics. Complexity i.e. the total effective information is defined as bytes remaining after compression and after rounding up the numbers using half the mapping accuracy (effective precision). It is postulated that the mapping efficiency, for an area of given size and limited budget, is basically a function of inspection intensity and mapping accuracy. Both measures are illustrated using the Meuse and Ebergötzen case studies (gstat, plotKML packages). The results demonstrate that, for mapping organic matter (Meuse data set), there is a gain in the mapping efficiency when using regression-kriging versus ordinary kriging: mapping efficiency is 7\% better and the information production efficiency about 25\% better (3.99 vs 3.14 EUR B−1 for the GZIP compression algorithm). For mapping sand content (Ebergötzen data set), the mapping efficiency for both ordinary kriging and regression-kriging is about the same; the information production efficiency is 29\% better for regression-kriging (37.1 vs 27.7 EUR B−1 for the GZIP compression algorithm). Information production efficiency is possibly a more robust measure of mapping quality than mapping efficiency because: (1) it is scale-independent, (2) it can be more easily related to the concept of effective information content, and (3) it accounts for the extrapolation effects. The limitation of deriving the information production efficiency is that both reliable estimate of the model uncertainty and the mapping accuracy is required.},

The problem of merging Gaussian mixtures is not statistically identifiable, therefore merging algorithms have to be based on subjective cluster concepts. Cluster concepts based on unimodality and misclassification probabilities (“patterns”) are distinguished. Several different hierarchical merging methods are proposed for different cluster concepts, based on the ridgeline analysis of modality of Gaussian mixtures, the dip test, the Bhattacharyya dissimilarity, a direct estimator of misclassification and the strength of predicting pairwise cluster memberships. The methods are compared by a simulation study and application to two real datasets. A new visualisation method of the separation of Gaussian mixture components, the ordered posterior plot, is also introduced.},

  abstract = {Digital terrain classification is of elementary importance for model-based prediction of the spatial distribution of soil properties and local water balance. This study describes a terrain analysis method that combines modeled and defined geomorphographic terrain attributes with detailed field knowledge and local mapping experience. 450 forest soil profiles were used to statistically analyze the correlation to soil properties. The result is a two-stage hierarchical terrain classification approach that provides a differentiated and satisfactory reproduction of characteristic terrain attributes in the primary landscape units. As field surveys show, modeled steep slopes, ridges, slope edges, convex and concave slope formations correlate well to local landform elements. Up to now, the results for mid slope modeling have been unsatisfactory. Furthermore, non-relevant or incorrectly delimitated landform elements were also modeled, making manual correction indispensible. In order for terrain modeling to be feasible it is necessary to entail detailed terrain knowledge of the region to be modeled. In this study, statistical analyses of the correlation between soil properties and modeled landform elements were conducted. The results show that steep slopes, convex and concave slope formations, steep stream channels and rock faces correlate well to soil properties. A few single relations were found for plateaus and ridges and trough-shaped valleys. Slope edges and mid slopes show almost no characteristic soil properties. Modeled landform elements are the most essential predictor for the development of prediction models for forest soil properties. The complex morphographic terrain classification approach, described in this study, is a feasible spatial and hierarchical basis for decision-based prediction models.},

Single-component soil polygons from conventional soil survey maps of the Langley–Vancouver Map Area, British Columbia (Canada), were used to generate randomized training points for 9 parent material classes. Each point was intersected with values from 27 topographic indices derived from a 100 m DEM. RF's mtry parameter was optimized using multiple replicates of 5-fold cross validation and parent material predictions were made for the region. Predictive parent material maps were validated through comparisons with legacy soil survey maps and 307 field points. Results show that predictions made by a non-optimized RF resulted in a kappa index of 89.6\% when validated with legacy soil survey data from single-component polygons and a kappa index of 79.5\% when validated with field data. Variable reduction and mtry optimization resulted in minimal improvements in RF predictions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RF as a machine learning and data mining approach; however, the need for reliable training data was highlighted by less reliable results for polygon disaggregation in portions of the map where fewer training data points could be established.},

"across the region where a close association exists between the topographic landscape form and the characteristics of the unconsolidated parent material." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=1}{Heung et al 2014:141})
\par
"The majority of digital soil mapping studies reviewed by McBratney et al. (2003) used bedrock geology as a surrogate predictor for parent material— an approach that may be adequate for environments where the soils are predominantly derived from residual materials. But for environments influenced by glaciation and where geomorphic transport processes have significantly influenced the nature and distribution of parent material, bedrock geology, when used alone, likely provides an incomplete depiction of the influence of parent materials on soil properties. Consequently, transported parent materials may not be represented and the resulting maps would potentially become biased in favor of residual materials (Lawley and Smith, 2008)."

"Extracting the knowledge from existing soil maps is complicated because such maps typically include a large number of multicomponent map units, and therefore lack a spatially explicit representation of the soil's class and attributes (Hole and Campbell, 1985; Webster and Beckett, 1968; Zhu and Band, 1994)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=2}{Heung et al 2014:142})

"The decision tree modeling approach has many advantages. Firstly, it is a particularly useful modeling approach for handling non-parametric data where the predictors are not characterized as having a specific distribution (Breiman et al., 1984). Secondly, decision trees are not sensitive to missing data, to the inclusion of irrelevant predictors, or to the presence of outliers. Furthermore, decision trees operate effectively using numerical, ordinal, binary, and categorical datasets" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=2}{Heung et al 2014:142})

"Three different methods for developing the training dataset were used with different allocations of the training points according to the following approaches: (1) equal number of points per parent material subclass, (2) equal number of points per polygon, and (3) the number of points was determined as an areaweighted proportion of the subclass' extent over the entire study area."

"Variable reduction has previously been shown to result in slight error reductions (Svetnik et al., 2003; 2004), or to have minimal effect on the RF classifier (Xiong et al., 2012) through the removal of potentially irrelevant predictor variables" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=6}{Heung et al 2014:146})

"Three approaches for assessing the predictions made by RF were used. Firstly, RF predictions were compared to the single-component polygons used as training areas from the soil survey. Secondly, RF predictions were compared to the multi-component polygons from the soil survey in order to examine RF's ability to disaggregate complex mapping units. Finally, the RF predictions were validated using point data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=6}{Heung et al 2014:146})

"Due to the forested and mountainous terrain, the supplemental data points were located along areas with good access and in places that reflected the range of materials present." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=7}{Heung et al 2014:147})

"At thefirst level, a predicted cell was considered valid if the validation point matched the prediction at that exact location (r = 0). At the second level, if a validation point matched a predicted cell that was located within a radius of 1 cell (r = 1), or within 100 m, surrounding the validation point, the predicted cell was considered valid."

"For the equal sampling by polygon approach, however, the OOB error rates were more than 10\% lower than the disagreement with soil survey" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=7}{Heung et al 2014:147})
\par
"These discrepancies suggest that the OOB error rates may not be the most reliable measure of class error; hence, the overall agreement with soil survey and kappa indices were used to select the sampling approach used for the parameter optimization and variable reduction analyses." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=8}{Heung et al 2014:148})
\par
"Overall agreement and kappa were highest for the area-weighted sampling approach when compared to the single-component polygons from the soil survey (Table 3). Moran and Bui (2002) noted that the area-weighted sampling approach performed better because more training data points were used to represent geographically extensive classes in order to capture a greater amount of variability that occurs under these classes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=8}{Heung et al 2014:148})

"The discrepancy in performance between majority and minority classes was expected as machine-learning algorithms are recognized for their poor performance for minority classes (ie. Kubat and Matwin, 1997; Van Hulse et al., 2007)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=8}{Heung et al 2014:148})
\par
"We recognize that the potential problem that may arise with the use of the area-weighted sampling approach is that such an approach would lead to an unbalanced training dataseta common problem for various machine-learning approaches (Galar et al., 2011; Van Hulse and Khoshgoftaar, 2009; Van Hulse et al., 2007)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=8}{Heung et al 2014:148})

"Despite these differences, this study was primarily aimed at producing a parent material map with the lowest overall error and hence, the area-weighted sample set was selected for all remaining analyses." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=8}{Heung et al 2014:148})
\par
"A rigorous study in addressing the issue of an unbalanced dataset was beyond the scope of this study; however, such a study would be of use in cases where a study's objective is to predict the presence of rare soils or unique features in a landscape."

"it was determined that the OOB error rate was a fairly adequate measure of the model error when compared to the 5-fold CV error rates." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=8}{Heung et al 2014:148})
\par
"A detailed further examination between environmental covariates and parent material classes was beyond the scope of this study since the topographic indices were all derived from the same DEM;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=8}{Heung et al 2014:148})

"an inherently high level of covariance between the indices would make such a detailed analysis to be highly complex." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=9}{Heung et al 2014:149})

"Hence, it was found that variable reduction did not necessarily result in an improvement in RF performance with respect to the CV error rates" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=9}{Heung et al 2014:149})
\par
"Furthermore, the minimal degradation in RF predictions when the predictors were reduced to p = 9 indicates that, for our study area, RF is insensitive to the presence of irrelevant predictors" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=9}{Heung et al 2014:149})
\par
"Although this study only examined a single approach for variable reduction, further studies may explore alternative dimension reduction approaches, such as the use of principal components as predictors for RF" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=9}{Heung et al 2014:149})
\par
"There was a high overall agreement between the RF predictions and single-component polygons from soil survey data (Table 4)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=9}{Heung et al 2014:149})

"The distinctions between these parent materials were not entirely clear in the soil survey map (Luttmerding, 1981) for several reasons" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=10}{Heung et al 2014:150})

"Firstly, colluvial and morainal components were frequently coupled together in 481 multicomponent polygons; and therefore not included in the training dataset." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=10}{Heung et al 2014:150})
\par
"Consequently, the smaller scale mapping of the Coastal Mountains inherently resulted in greater generalization of the map units where localized colluvial deposits would not have been mapped as a single-component map unit, but rather, a multicomponent unit." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=10}{Heung et al 2014:150})

"Both the optimization of mtry and variable reduction had little influence on the disaggregation of multi-component polygons" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E257VYPN?page=10}{Heung et al 2014:150})

This study examined such a comparison over the Okanagan Valley and Kamloops region of British Columbia where good quality soil pit and soil survey data were available. A standard set of environmental variables including vegetative, climatic, and topographic indices were used to predict soil Great Groups in accordance with the Canadian System of Soil Classification. The pit-derived training dataset was developed using n = 478 points from the British Columbia Soil Information System while the polygon-derived training dataset was developed through random sampling of single-component soil survey map units based on an area-weighted approach. In both cases, the training points were intersected with a suite of 18 environmental covariates, reduced from 27 covariates using principal component analysis, and submitted to a machine-learner for predictions at a 100 m spatial resolution. Four single-model learners (CART, k-nearest neighbor, multinomial logistic regression, and logistic model tree) and five ensemble-model learners (CART with bagging, k-nearest neighbor with bagging, multinomial logistic regression with bagging, logistic model trees with bagging, and Random Forest) were compared. Surfaces of prediction uncertainty were produced using ignorance uncertainty and results were validated using a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. Predictions made using polygon-derived training data were consistently higher in accuracy across all models where the Random Forest model was the most effective learner with C = 61\% accuracy when using pit-derived training data and C = 68\% accuracy when using polygon-derived training data. Comparing single-model and ensemble-learner models, the bagging algorithm resulted in a 2–11\% increase in accuracy when using pit-derived training data.

"The classification and regression tree (CART) is a hierarchal modeling approach that consists of nodes and leaves, where at each node, it consists of an if-then statement that partitions the training data by maximizing the within-node homogeneity and the between-node heterogeneity based on a node-splitting rule (Breiman et al., 1984)."

"Accuracy metrics included overall agreement, C, which represents the percentage of correctly matched cases between prediction and validation datasets. In addition to the overall agreement, accuracy metrics included the calculation of the quantity disagreement (Q) and allocation disagreement (A) that could be calculated using the confusion matrices produced from the validation procedure (Pontius and Millones, 2011; Warrens, 2015). Both disagreement values are the result of decomposing the total disagreement, D, as follows:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HWQYY88A?page=7}{Heung et al 2017:57})

"Accuracies for results using pit-derived training data ranged from 47 to 61\% with the RF model having the highest accuracy; in comparison, results using polygon-derived training data ranged from 50 to 70\% where kNN+ had the highest accuracy." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HWQYY88A?page=10}{Heung et al 2017:60})

"To investigate the influence of map scale on the soil survey accuracy, large-scale surveys had a higher accuracy of 67\% for the 1:20,000 and 1:50,000 scales in comparison to the reconnaissance mapping created at a 1:125,000 scale where the accuracy was 48\%." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HWQYY88A?page=10}{Heung et al 2017:60})
\par
"The discrepancy in accuracies may be partly due to the small number (n = 25) of points located on the 1:125,000 polygons; however, the more likely reason is due to the loss of detail and the greater amount of inclusions when mapping at smaller scales where the subtle variations in environmental covariates become generalized." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HWQYY88A?page=10}{Heung et al 2017:60})
\par
"Most noticeable, however, was that even though single-component map units were used to derive one of the training datasets, the resulting predictions using the CART+, RF, kNN, and kNN+ models all had higher accuracies than the original soil survey" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HWQYY88A?page=10}{Heung et al 2017:60})
\par
"These results were surprising because similar to Collard et al. (2014) that used an existing soil survey at a 1:250,000 scale to calibrate a model, their predictions had higher accuracies in comparison to the original soil map using MLR, RF, and classification tree models."

\par
"When the accuracies of the pit-derived predictions that coincided with single-component polygons and and the accuracies of the polygons were compared, the results seemed to suggest that DSM approaches using models such as CART+, RF, kNN, and kNN+ models could potentially produce outputs that are more accurate than maps produced using conventional mapping approaches when using the same point dataset (Table 4)."

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping makes extensive use of auxiliary information, such as that contained in remote sensing images and digital elevation models. However, it cannot do without taking samples of the soil itself. Therefore, methods and guidelines need to be developed that assist users in designing spatial sample configurations for use in digital soil mapping. Existing geostatistical methods are insufficient because these typically have been developed for situations in which there is no auxiliary information. In this chapter, we explore how the existing methods may be extended to the case in which the auxiliary information is spatially exhaustive and where soil mapping is done using universal kriging. We develop and illustrate a methodology that optimizes the spatial configuration of observations by minimizing the spatially averaged universal kriging variance. The universal kriging variance incorporates trend estimation error as well as spatial interpolation error. Hence, the optimized sample configuration strikes a balance between an optimal distribution of observations in feature and geographic space. The results show that optimal distribution in feature space prevails over optimal distribution in geographic space when the stochastic component of the universal kriging model is weakly spatially autocorrelated. It also prevails when the total number of observations is small. In all other cases, the optimal configuration is close to that obtained with minimization of only the spatial interpolation error. Application to a variety of real-world cases with multiple predictors and different spatial dependence structures is needed to support and generalise these preliminary findings.},

  abstract = {Understanding the limitations of soil data is essential for both managing environmental systems effectively and encouraging the responsible use of soil data. Explicit assessment of the uncertainties associated with soil data, and their storage in a soil database are therefore important. In practice, users will not want to separate ‘uncertain data’ from ‘certain data’ and will therefore require a single database that meets all the requirements of a conventional database, as well as the ability to handle uncertain data specifically. This chapter presents a framework that facilitates the storage of information about soil-data quality, including the uncertainties associated with soil data, in a conventional database design. It comprises a methodology for classifying data according to their attribute scale, which influences the structure of an uncertainty model, and their space–time variability, which determines the need for autocorrelation functions in describing uncertainty. In terms of the former, the key distinctions are among real numbers on a continuous domain, real or integer numbers on a discrete domain, categorical data and narrative data. In terms of the latter, the key distinctions are among data that are constant in space and time (e.g. universal constants); data that vary in time, but not in space; data that vary in space but not in time; and data that vary both in time and space. Thus, we distinguish 13 ‘data types’ to which individual datasets may be assigned. This simplifies the process of assessing uncertainties about soil data because characteristic uncertainty models can be defined for each data type. In general terms, an uncertain soil variable is completely specified by its probability distribution function (pdf). However, the complexity of a pdf varies with the 13 ‘data types’ identified. For example, the (cumulative) pdf of an uncertain numerical constant is simply a nondecreasing function on the real line. The database stores this function or some parameters of it, such as the mean and variance. Other data types are associated with more complex pdfs. For example, an uncertain categorical soil map requires the probability of each soil type occurring at any location to be defined (local uncertainty), as well as the spatial dependencies between these probabilities at multiple locations (spatial uncertainty). In practice, the complexity of the joint pdf will make it difficult or impossible to identify. Assumptions (such as a stationarity assumption) are therefore required to reduce the number of model parameters.},

The Mt Fitton test site in South Australia was chosen to test the ability of the ASTER instrument for geological mapping having been previously surveyed by several visible-shortwave IR and thermal IR airborne remote sensing instruments and several field campaigns collecting relevant spectral measurements. These previous airborne remote sensing surveys and field campaigns successfully mapped a suite of intrusives and sedimentary units with some greenschist metamorphic and localised hydrothermal alteration. Visible-NIR ASTER channels successfully mapped green vegetation and iron oxide information. ASTER SWIR data were spectrally unmixed into four spectrally recognizable endmembers that relate to areas rich in talc, chlorite, white mica and carbonate mineralogies. This result was confirmed using IRIS field spectra resampled to ASTER resolution wavelengths. Quartz, carbonate and talc-tremolite rich units at Mt Fitton were also discriminated using ASTER's thermal infrared data. These results from low level ASTER data products indicated that ASTER could discriminate mineral groups not achievable from Landsat TM, though more precise mineral species mapping is not possible.},

  abstract = {Conventional soil maps may be the best available source for spatial soil information in data-limited areas, including individual soil properties. Spatial disaggregation of these maps, or mapping the unmapped soil components, offers potential for transforming them into spatially referenced soil class distributions. We used an automated, iterative classification tree approach to spatially disaggregate a patchwork of soil surveys covering Western Australia (2.5 Â 106 km2) to produce raster surfaces of soil class occurrence. The resulting rasters capture the broad spatial patterns of dominant soils and harmonise soil class designations across most survey boundaries. More than 43 000 archived profiles were used to evaluate the accuracy of the rasters. In 20\% of cases, the predicted soil class with the highest probability matched that recorded for the profile; when any of the three highest probability soil classes predicted were considered correct, the global accuracy was 40\%. The accuracy increased to 71\% when the rasters were reassembled to represent a higher level in the soil classification system. The predicted surfaces retained features related to the mapping intensity of the original surveys and generally had higher prediction accuracy of profile soil class where the surface geochemistry was more homogeneous. The best indicator of prediction accuracy was how common the profile soil class was in the original mapping (94\% variance explained); profile observations collected during soil survey may be biased towards rare soils, making them less suitable for validation or modelling directly from point data.},

"The diverse disciplines seeking spatial soil information require something different from the conventional (legacy) soil survey maps produced throughout the last century, demanding high resolution, pixel-based soil products accompanied by uncertainty measures (Grunwald 2010)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4P8RG8HE?page=1}{Holmes et al 2015:865})
\par
"Existing (legacy) soil profile data are often irregularly distributed, imprecisely located and collected in an ad hoc manner to support surveys or specific objectives rather than to meet statistical design criteria (Carré et al. 2007; Hewitt et al. 2008)."

"A DSM literature review by Grunwald (2009) found 15.6\% of recent (2007-08) papers addressed prediction of soil taxonomic or ecological classes, down from the 30\% reported in an earlier review by McBratney et al. (2003). Although point data are easier to work with,finding a way to unlock the knowledge of soil variation embedded in conventional soil maps may benefit a very large area globally."

  abstract = {Background and Aims: Spain has more than one million hectares of vineyards, being the first country in the world, and the third in production of wine. Local zoning studies have been carried out using bioclimatic indexes to show the influence of climate; however, no detailed study has been undertaken at national level that included the current area of vineyards. The aim of this study was to prepare a thermal characterisation and zoning of winegrowing areas in Spain through four bioclimatic indexes.
Methods and Results: From data of the European Climate Assessment \& Dataset (1980–2010), four bioclimatic indexes adapted to viticulture were calculated and integrated into a geographic information system, which allowed the graphical visualisation of their patterns by means of geostatistical interpolation techniques (kriging). The results show that there is a significant spatial variability of the climate from a winegrowing perspective, and each index defines the differences between the climatic classes suitable for viticulture.
Conclusions: In order to define and assess the climatic differences in wine production and the suitability of the Spanish mainland territory, it is necessary to combine several indexes. Significance of the Study: For the first time, the climatic variability of Spain has been described and the peculiarities that differentiate its vineyards have been highlighted. High-resolution kriged maps have made this study possible.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a new method for the digital mapping of taxonomic soil units via fuzzy taxonomy and fuzzy clustering. In principle, this respects the continuous character of the soil but can result in traditional crisp soil maps. A part of the Moravskoslezské Beskydy Mts. (Czech Republic) was the testing area. Fuzzified taxonomic soil information from 106 soil pits with 75 geomorphometric parameters (potential environmental covariates of soil units) derived from a 10 m LIDAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used for the input data. Another 60 soil pits were used for the validation of the results. Generalized linear models (GLM) of the relationship between fuzzified taxonomic soil information (membership of soil pits to particular soil types) and all geomorphometric parameters were used for the selection of 8 geomorphometric parameters as environmental covariates of soil taxonomic units (Catchment Slope, Elevation, Local Upslope Curvature, Gradient Difference, Melton Ruggedness Number, Slope Height, Modified Catchment Area, Multiresolution Index of Ridge Top Flatness). The fuzzy cmeans clustering of selected covariates led to the delimitation of soil-landscape units. The taxonomic meanings of the soil-landscape units (membership of the particular soil type to the particular type of soil-landscape unit) were determined on the basis of membership of soil pits to the soil types, and membership of the pixels with soil pits to the given type of soil-landscape unit. Every pixel obtained an individual membership to each soil type in this way. The defuzzification process (the assignment of a given pixel to only one resultant soil subtype) considered the first and second largest membership of pixels to particular soil types. To express the scientific reliability of the results, methods for measuring uncertainty and two modified confusion indexes are calculated. This approach shows 26\% full agreement, 64\% partial agreement and 10\% disagreement between the modelled and observed point data. The result significantly exceeds the accuracy of conventional soil maps in the tested area, as well as in some other previously investigated regions of the Western Carpathians.},

  abstract = {Coastal floodplains are commonly underlain by sulfidic sediments and coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS). Oxidation of sulfidic sediments leads to increases in acidity and mobilisation of trace metals, resulting in an increase in the concentrations of conducting ions in sediment and pore water. The distribution of these sediments on floodplains is highly heterogeneous. Accurately identifying the distribution of CASS is essential for developing targeted management strategies. One approach is the use of digital soil mapping (DSM) using ancillary information. Proximal sensing instruments such as an EM38 can provide data on the spatial distribution of soil salinity, which is associated with CASS, and can be complemented by digital elevation models (DEM). We used EM38 measurements of the apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) in the horizontal and vertical modes in combination with a high resolution DEM to delineate the spatial distribution of CASS. We used a fuzzy k-means algorithm to cluster the data. The fuzziness exponent, number of classes (k) and distance metric (i.e. Euclidean, Mahalanobis and diagonal) were varied to determine a set of parameters to identify CASS. The mean-squared prediction error variance of the class mean of various soil properties (e.g. EC1:5 and pH) was used to identify which of these metrics was suitable for further analysis (i.e. Mahalanobis) and also determine the optimal number of classes (i.e. k = 4). The final map is consistent with previously defined soil–landscape units generated using traditional soil profile description, classification and mapping. The DSM approach is amenable for evaluation on a larger scale and in order to refine CASS boundaries previously mapped using the traditional approach or to identify CASS areas that remain unmapped.},

\par
"Although a complete and logical procedure for extracting watershed ridges, channel networks, and related topographic features from a raster-based digital elevation model (DEM) data set has been well established (Douglas 1986), approaches for handling flow paths are continuously discussed and revised" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=2}{Huang et al 2016:169})
\par
"The earliest proposed rule for determining a single representative flow direction for a given cell is known as the eight-direction (D8) method (O'Callaghan and Mark 1984), which clearly defines the upstream drainage area and can be adopted for partitioning subwatersheds. However, this algorithm is criticized for its incompetence in performing flow dispersion on gridded elevation data sets" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=2}{Huang et al 2016:169})
\par
"To overcome this problem, several multiple-flow-direction (MFD) methods were successively suggested" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=2}{Huang et al 2016:169})
\par
"All of these approaches remove the defect of the D8 method to produce the dispersive effect from a cell to its neighboring cells with lower elevation, but they induce the inconsistent physical definition for the contributing area" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=3}{Huang et al 2016:170})
\par
"For creating a dispersion effect when adopting the MFD methods, the assumption of partitioning flow into multiple downslope receiving cells is a key issue" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=3}{Huang et al 2016:170})
\par
"because this assumption significantly dominates the overall drainage structure in a watershed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=3}{Huang et al 2016:170})
\par
"The primary strategy for apportioning the flow fractions from a cell draining to downslope receiving cells is mainly based on the local gradients of elevation with the neighboring cells. Considering that the fixed flow-partition fractions employed in the MFD methods cannot effectively reflect the impact of local terrain conditions, an adaptive scheme, known as MFD-md method (Qin et al. 2007), was therefore conceived by adjusting the flow-partition exponent of the equation form proposed by Quinn et al. (1991) according to the local maximum downslope gradient" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=3}{Huang et al 2016:170})
\par
"O'Neil and Shortridge (2013) proposed to quantify flow direction uncertainty from DEMs by comparing a coarse resolution data set with a finer reference data set to lead to a better understanding for the impact of grid size." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=3}{Huang et al 2016:170})
\par
"Consequently, the main purpose of this study is to denote the feature inherent in each flow-direction algorithm and further assess how the assumptions of flow direction affect the extraction of geomorphological factors that are used for hydrological simulations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=3}{Huang et al 2016:170})
\par
"This study intends to quantify the extent of flow dispersion and concentration on the land surface when using different flow-direction methods. Four MFD methods, including the multiple-direction (MD8) algorithm, triangular single-direction (D1) algorithm, triangular multiple-direction (MD1) algorithm, and four-direction (D4) algorithm, were applied, and the results were compared with the results generated from the single-direction (D8) algorithm" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=4}{Huang et al 2016:171})
\par
"To clearly illustrate the rules of various flow-direction methods, a hypothetical raster elevation data set, shown in Figure 1a, was adopted. According to the feature of flow diversion, the DEM-based flow-direction methods can be classified into two broad categories." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=4}{Huang et al 2016:171})
\par
"One is the single-flow-direction method, also known as the eight-direction (D8) algorithm" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=4}{Huang et al 2016:171})
\par
"which routes the total mass of flow water from one cell to the adjacent cell with the steepest descent, as shown in Figure 1b, to manifest the most concentrative feature of flow." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=4}{Huang et al 2016:171})
\par
"The other one is the MFD method" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=4}{Huang et al 2016:171})
\par
"2007), which can deliver the water mass to more than one adjacent cell to achieve a comparatively dispersive flow pattern" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=4}{Huang et al 2016:171})
\par
"1991). In this method, the water mass of a cell is proportionately distributed to all of the neighboring eight cells that have lower elevation, as shown in Figure 1c, to mimic the dispersion of flow." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=5}{Huang et al 2016:172})
\par
"To achieve a compromise between the simplicity of the D8 method and maintaining a certain degree of flow dispersion, Tarboton (1997) proposed the triangular single-direction (D1) algorithm" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=5}{Huang et al 2016:172})
\par
"In this algorithm, the flow direction routes to the facet with the steepest descent, which is determined by an auxiliary calculation of the radian angle ri" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=5}{Huang et al 2016:172})
\par
"in which e0, e1, and e2 are the elevation values of each the three adjacent cells that compose a hypothetical triangular facet andΔx is the pixel resolution of the DEM data set." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=5}{Huang et al 2016:172})
\par
"The method known as the triangular multiple-direction (MD1)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=6}{Huang et al 2016:173})

"This new MFD method integrates the virtues of the MD8 algorithm (Quinn et al. 1991) with the concept of triangular facets used in the D1 algorithm (Tarboton 1997)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=6}{Huang et al 2016:173})
\par
"As illustrated in Figure 1e, the two steepest triangular facets are utilized to determine the flow directions by grading the magnitude of sti (calculated using Equations (5)-(7)), and the principle to further partition the water mass from a cell refers to the method suggested by Quinn et al. (1991) as shown in Equation (1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=6}{Huang et al 2016:173})

"If the outlet location is assigned at R5C5, the drainage area can be delineated as the region shaded with light gray color" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=7}{Huang et al 2016:174})
\par
"The flow accumulation value (FAV) at the watershed outlet is known to be exactly equal to the number of cells within the watershed boundary." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=7}{Huang et al 2016:174})
\par
"As a result, a total of 12 cells can be derived corresponding to the R5C5 outlet. It should be noted that in this article the watershed extent extracted in this manner is referred to as 'flow-dispersion area', which indicates the maximum upstream extent that can affect the flow condition at the appointed outlet. However, another relative factor, known as the 'flow-concentration area', specifically representing the upstream contributing area, is used to denote the ability of collecting water mass at the outlet" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=7}{Huang et al 2016:174})
\par

\par
"For a summary description, when performing a single-direction (D8) method, the flow-dispersion area is certainly equal to the flow-concentration area.

"Except for the watershed area, the length of the longest watercourse is also one of the major factors when conducting hydrological design work." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=8}{Huang et al 2016:175})
\par
"As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the watershed extents due to flow dispersion show substantial differences when applying the D8 and MD8 algorithms. This leads to much dissimilarity between the two algorithms" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D3ZW8QYG?page=8}{Huang et al 2016:175})

"When applying the D1 algorithm, more than 70\% of cells are assigned to two downslope directions. For the case of the MD8 algorithm, approximately 47\% of cells are apportioned to four neighboring cells with lower elevations."

  abstract = {The concept of soil security has been proposed with the dimensions of capability, condition, capital, connectivity, and codification of soil. However, it remains a challenge to accurately and efficiently assess the soil's capability and condition as a function of soil change. The idea of genoform and phenoform was proposed 20 years ago and recently revitalized. Herein, we were inspired by these concepts to develop a general approach and concepts of genosoils and phenosoils for distinguishing the soil changes within soil mapping units as affected by human activities. Across a 220 km2 district with a diversity in landforms, parent materials, and land use types, we generated maps of Pre-European (soil classes that existed prior to agricultural development) soil classes using a digital soil mapping approach. Based on the land use change, Pre-European genosoils and present genosoils and phenosoils were identified and mapped within each of the Pre-European soil classes. The measured topsoil (0–10 cm) and subsoil (40–50 cm) properties have shown differences between the present genosoils and phenosoils. By objectively calculating the distances between the present genosoils and phenosoils in a principal component space using a recently published comprehensive soil classification system, several present phenosoils displayed significant differences among several soil properties (distance {$>$} 8\% of overall distance) and were redefined as new genosoils. The approach has successfully mapped genosoils and phenosoils within PreEuropean soil classes at the district scale and identified shifts between present genosoils and phenosoils. It showed potential in detecting areas of soil changes due to human activities. Future work is required to separate seasonal fluctuations from long-term variations in NDVI and improve land use classification using remote sensing data. The method developed here can be applied in areas without remnant vegetation to separate the soil condition from capability by gauging phenosoils against genosoils.},

Afterward, remote sensing datasets such as Landsat images can be used to delineate the extent of soil disturbance within these soil mapping units as a function of human activities and assign them different genosoils and phenosoils. Lastly, we can verify these genosoils and phenosoils by collecting soil samples within these genosoils and phenosoils and measuring the soil physical and chemical properties.

The soil-landscape model, on which the soil survey is based, is an operative paradigm. An extreme reliance on tacit knowledge, the knowledge gained by experience, creates serious inefficiencies, both in learning the soillandscape paradigm and in disseminating the information resulting from its application. This article introduces concepts important to understanding paradigm theory and the nature of tacit knowledge. Among these are elements of Gestalt psychology, the theory of natural families, maps as conveyors of knowledge, and the linguistic nature of human perception. Students and field soil scientists should be provided explicit instruction concerning the paradigm on which soil mapping and interpretation are based. I also recommend that more of the soil geographic relationships discovered while making detailed soil maps be described and published so that the knowledge can be communicated to others.},

In New Zealand, the spatial distribution of loess has a significant influence on soil properties, and recent regional-scale quantitative models have attempted to model the thickness and pattern of this important soil parent material. Here we apply two quantitative modelling techniques, automatic landform stratification and environmental correlation, to test and refine loess-landscape models for a higher-resolution study window in North Otago, South Island. Field validation demonstrated that previously developed coarse-scale models were moderately successful in predicting loess thickness, but these models required refinement. Automatic landform stratification based on conceptual models of loess distribution was a good predictor of primary loess in the field (85\% success), but predicted poorly occurrence of colluvial and thin loess. Environmental correlation using nominal logistic regression with equal prior probabilities was a good predictor of primary loess in the field (70\% success), but predicted poorly occurrence of colluvial and thin loess. Quantitative loess-landscape models need to be further refined using higher-resolution terrain data derived from LIDAR and photogrammetric surveys. In addition, morphometric similarities between different loess landscapes needs to be addressed and the historical and spatial contingency inherent in loess-landscape evolution incorporated in models for improved spatial prediction of loess parent materials.},

  abstract = {Soil classification as a world exercise consists of predominantly individual organizations, creating locally meaningful categories for regional soils. This process has inevitably created a recognized disconnect between classification systems, and a push for a universal classification has been proposed. In this paper, as a way of standardization between systems, soil taxa at the great group level from two separate regions and soil classification systems, Australia and the United States of America were represented by separate databases of soil profile descriptions (SPDs) comprising the same 23 properties at 18 depth intervals. Taxa centroids from Soil Taxonomy (ST) and the Australian Soil Classification System (ASC) were calculated via principal component analysis. Convex hulls of each soil order of both systems were created and the associations each taxon had with other individuals in the same taxon discussed, as well as the variance. We determined that ASC orders have smaller overall dispersion compared with the ST. The influence of each property to the overall taxonomic distances was also explored. It was concluded that this analysis opened the way for the possibility of comparing differing taxonomies and could pave the way for a more comprehensive classification method.},

  abstract = {Many different soil classification systems exist around the world and soil profile descriptions have always been difficult to successfully translate between taxonomic systems. In order to do this, there is the requirement for a comprehensive soil classification. This database needs to be comprehensive, non-duplicated, have the capacity for other suitable taxa to be added to, and at the same time to be small and simple. In this paper, we proposed a nearest-neighbour distance calculated based on the principal component space of the soil variables to remove redundancy of the existing soil classification and evaluate the equivalence between the different soil classification system. After removing the redundancy, Great Groups of the New Zealand Classification and Australian Soil Classification and Soil Groups of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources were sequentially added to the Great Groups of the US Soil Taxonomy. This resulted in a comprehensive soil classification. The comprehensive soil classification allowed for the further addition of taxa from other soil classification and was capable of robustly allocating unknown soil profiles via either hard or fuzzy classification methods. The possibility merging and simplifying of such different systems demonstrates the possibility of similar mergers with taxonomies of other nations, creating a fully populated taxonomic space – a truly global or universal soil classification system.},

  abstract = {Soil taxonomies over the world are incongruent- based on different tiers and different sets of properties. This second paper is concerned with understanding the relationships of each tier (Order, Suborder and Great Group) in both Soil Taxonomy (ST) and the Australian Soil Classification system (ASC) using mean nearest neighbour distances and convex hull areas in two principal component dimensions. It is determined that in most instances, convex hull comparisons using only two principal components, representing 30\% of the variation in the data describe much of the variability between and within the orders, suborders and great groups of each classification system. These are useful for visual comparisons of taxa at various levels. Mean nearest-neighbour distances can include all 414 variables if necessary, which is more rigorous but complex. Both distance calculations and convex hulls highlight the same associations between taxa from ASC and ST. Both these methods demonstrate the robust soil classification capability of the ST and the ASC, but with convex hull sizes and nearest-neighbour distances that are smaller, the ASC proves to be slightly more coherent. The two systems occupy somewhat different areas in PC space, and ST covers a larger overall area, demonstrating that ASC is a purpose-built classification for Australian conditions while ST Is a more general system that can cover a wider variety of soils and management issues. We also show that great groups in ST are at about the same level of taxonomic generalization as great groups of the ASC. Combining the best elements and taxa of both these systems would be a positive step in the creation of a comprehensive system.},

  abstract = {Thin plate smoothing splines provide accurate, operationally straightforward and computationally efficient solutions to the problem of the spatial interpolation.of annual mean rainfall for a standard period from point data which contains many short period rainfall means. The analyses depend on developing a statistical model of the spatial variation of the observed rainfall means, considered as noisy estimates of standard period means. The error structure of this model has two components which allow separately for strong spatially correlated departures of observed short term means from standard period means and for uncorrelated deficiencies in the representation of standard period mean rainfall by a smooth function of position and elevation. Thin plate splines, with the degree of smoothing determining by minimising generalised cross validation, can estimate this smooth function in two ways. First, the spatially correlated error structure of the data can be accommodated directly by estimating the corresponding non-diagonal error covariance matrix. Secondly, spatial correlation in the data error structure can be removed by standardising the observed short term means to standard period mean estimates using linear regression. When applied to data both methods give similar interpolation accuracy, and error estimates of the fitted surfaces are in good agreement with residuals from withheld data. Simplified versions of the data error model, which require only minimal summary data at each location, are also presented. The interpolation accuracy obtained with these models is only slightly inferior to that obtained with more complete statistical models. It is shown that the incorporation of a continuous, spatially varying, dependence on appropriately scaled elevation makes a dominant contribution to surface accuracy. Incorporating dependence on aspect, as determined from a digital elevation model, makes only a marginal further improvement.},

  abstract = {Numerical classification methods may provide an alternative to manual landform delineation using aerial photographs, a subjective process that requires much knowledge of the landscape in question. Continuous classification (fuzzy set) methods and unsupervised (ISODATA) classification techniques were used to classify the landscape of a study area in southwestern Wisconsin, USA. Each pixel of a 10-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was grouped according to its membership in a continuous landform class. These classes were d\textasciitilde mnined by tt\textasciitilde{} natural clustering of the data in attribute space. Attributes used for the classification were elevation, slope, profile and tangent (related to plan) curvature, compound topographic (wetness) index, and incident solar radiation. The ISODATA classification assigned pixels to one, and only one, landform class while the continuous classification allocated relative class memberships to each pixel. The resulting classifications roughly follow subjective manual delineation lines but give more detailed results. These classification methods may prove useful for statistical analyses and determination of sample schemes.},

The study w as conducted in west Wollega zone of Ethiopia covering nearly 40 km2 of agricultural land, with the aim to explain variability of soils in the field, classify soils into mapping units and produce a map of these soils at a scale of 1:10000 using geostatistics. In this paper, soil mapping units (SMUs) were interchangeably used with management zones. Ten SMUs were identified in the study site. The SMU mean pH value varied between 5.3 in the SMU6 and 6.4 in the SMU7. Variation in soil texture, pH, exchangeable acidity, exchangeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), and plant available phosphorus (AvP), were observed within and among SMUs. Variability of soil parameters ranged from 1.06\% (Na) in the SMU5 to 172.94\% (AvP) in the SMU8. The OC and AvP content of all SMUs were found in the very low and low critical ranges. Intensive grid sampling had helped to produce digital soil maps and exposed soil heterogeneity across the landscape. We suggest that classification of fields into management zones was a remedy to low crop production occurred from uniform applications of nutrients and chemical amendments to significantly varying soils.},

  abstract = {An iterative procedure that implements the classification of continuous topography as a problem in digital image-processing automatically divides an area into categories of surface form; three taxonomic criteria–slope gradient, local convexity, and surface texture–are calculated from a square-grid digital elevation model (DEM). The sequence of programmed operations combines twofold-partitioned maps of the three variables converted to greyscale images, using the mean of each variable as the dividing threshold. To subdivide increasingly subtle topography, grid cells sloping at less than mean gradient of the input DEM are classified by designating mean values of successively lower-sloping subsets of the study area (nested means) as taxonomic thresholds, thereby increasing the number of output categories from the minimum 8 to 12 or 16. Program output is exemplified by 16 topographic types for the world at 1-km spatial resolution (SRTM30 data), the Japanese Islands at 270 m, and part of Hokkaido at 55 m. Because the procedure is unsupervised and reflects frequency distributions of the input variables rather than pre-set criteria, the resulting classes are undefined and must be calibrated empirically by subsequent analysis. Maps of the example classifications reflect physiographic regions, geological structure, and landform as well as slope materials and processes; fine-textured terrain categories tend to correlate with erosional topography or older surfaces, coarse-textured classes with areas of little dissection. In Japan the resulting classes approximate landform types mapped from airphoto analysis, while in the Americas they create map patterns resembling Hammond's terrain types or surface-form classes; SRTM30 output for the United States compares favorably with Fenneman's physical divisions. Experiments are suggested for further developing the method; the Arc/Info AML and the map of terrain classes for the world are available as online downloads.},

"In contrast, non-parametric approaches completely avoid this danger, since essentially no assumption about the form of f is made.

First, we attempt to understand the nature of the class imbalance problem by establishing a relationship between concept complexity, size of the training set and class imbalance level. Second, we discuss several basic re-sampling or cost-modifying methods previously proposed to deal with the class imbalance problem and compare their effectiveness. The results obtained by such methods on artificial domains are linked to results in real-world domains. Finally, we investigate the assumption that the class imbalance problem does not only affect decision tree systems but also affects other classification systems such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel method for classification and mapping of landform elements from a DEM based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) — a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular terrain morphology. A finite number of 498 geomorphons constitute a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A single scan of a DEM assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the method classifies landform elements at a range of different spatial scales with unprecedented computational efficiency. A general purpose geomorphometric map — an interpreted map of topography — is obtained by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efficiency of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this new method, a 30 m cell−1 geomorphometric map of the entire country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage of this map are briefly discussed. The computer implementation of the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.},

"The existing methods classify landforms on the basis of "geomorphometric variables" (Evans, 1972; Pike, 1988; MacMillan et al., 2004; Olaya, 2009)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=1}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:147})
\par
"These variables are real-valued numbers calculated from the DEM; most variables used in classification of landforms are local— they are calculated using thefirst and second derivatives of terrain surface." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=1}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:147})
\par
"The differences between different existing approaches focus on how to best utilize the information contained in geomorphometric variables, and on the choice of target units of classification." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=1}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:147})
\par
"Methods can be divided into those which are cell-based and those which are object based (Dragut and Blaschke, 2006; van Asselen and Seijmonsbergen, 2006; Dragut and Blaschke, 2008; Ghosh et al., 2009)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=1}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:147})

"use a classifier designed manually on the basis of expert knowledge and empirical evidence (Pennock et al., 1987; Skidmore, 1990; MacMillan et al., 2000; Gallant et al., 2005; Iwahashi and Pike, 2007; Minar and Evans, 2008) and those which use a classifier generated by a machine learning algorithm (Brown et al., 1998; Hengl and Rossiter, 2003; Prima et al., 2006; Ghosh et al., 2009)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"Finally, methods can be divided with respect to target units of classification (Minar and Evans, 2008); considered units include: landforms, landform elements, and physiographic units (Adediran et al., 2004; Iwahashi and Pike, 2007; Stepinski and Bagaria, 2009; Dragut and Eisank, 2012)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"A starting point is the observation that an analyst who manually classifies landforms from a DEM(using a map of shaded relief or a contour map) does not make decisions based on geomorphometric variables, but instead identifies the whole topographic patterns corresponding to specific landforms." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"Our method capitalizes on this observation; we classify landform elements using tools of computer vision rather than tools of differential geometry." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"Thus, our algorithm attempts to mimic the classification process carried out by a human analyst." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"Recall that image texture refers to the spatial arrangement of grayscale intensities in a selected region of an image. Similarly, landform elements can be thought of as a specific spatial arrangement of elevation values in a selected region of a DEM." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"we modify tools originally developed for texture classification and apply them for landform classification. In particular, we utilize the concept of Local Ternary Patterns (LTP) (Liao, 2010) to identify local landform elements." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"The set of all possible LTPs isfinite; taking into account rotational and reflectional symmetries there are only 498 different LTPs. We call these patterns (and their associated landform archetypes) geomorphons by analogy to textons (Julesz, 1981)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"Analogously, geomorphons are fundamental micro-structures of landscape." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"Because of theirfinite number (up to 498, but much less in DEMs pertaining to real terrestrial landscapes) the geomorphons are both terrain attributes and landform types at the same time." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"Instead of using afixed-size neighborhood to collect elevation values for determination of LTP, we use a neighborhood with size and shape that self-adapts to the local topography. This self-adaptation technique utilizes the line-of-sight principle (Lee, 1991; Nagy, 1994; Yokoyama et al., 2002) and ensures that landforms are identified at their most appropriate spatial scale." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"The process of generating such a map amounts to the reclassification of geomorphons based on a lookup table. We explain how to construct an appropriate lookup table and obtain a geomorphometric map— a general purpose map of interpreted topography that is robust to length scale and efficient to compute." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"This includes details on construction of LTP utilizing the line-of-sight principle, reduction of all LTPs to the set of 498 geomorphons, construction of lookup table for mapping of common landform elements, and details on computer implementation of our method." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"We also demonstrate the scaleflexibility of our method." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"an image is best segmented into its constituent structures on the basis of texture similarity (Malik et al., 2001)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"The texture descriptors that proved to be the most effective are all based on local patterns of gray level contrasts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"Thus, a neighbor is labeled 1 if its value exceeds the value of the central cell by at least t where t is a specified value of threshold. A neighbor is labeled−1 if its value is at least t smaller than the value of the central cell. Otherwise, the neighbor is labeled 0." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"the LTP, although still simple, provides enough structure to be utilized for the identification of a DEM's constituent landforms." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"This pattern can be shown in three different ways. First, visually as an octagon with each vertex colored in accordance with convention used in Panel B. Second, as a string of three symbols (+ = "higher",−= "lower", and 0= "same"); thefirst symbol in the string corresponds to the east neighbor and subsequent symbols correspond to the neighbors in counterclockwise order" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"Thus, thefinal representation of the pattern is its corresponding decimal number (2159 for the pattern shown in Fig. 1)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"In practice, a ternary pattern characterizing terrain type in the neighborhood of the central cell is determined not from simple differences in elevations (as illustrated in Fig. 1 for conceptual purposes), but rather from a quantityΔ which is derived through characterization of the local surface using the line-of-sight principle." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"This principle, originally proposed by Yokoyama et al. (2002) in connection with the notion of terrain openness, relates surface relief and horizontal distance by means of so-called zenith and nadir angles along the eight principal compass directions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=2}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:148})
\par
"For each profile a set of elevation angles DSL is calculated; the symbol denoting this set indicates a dependence on direction (D) and lookup distance or scale (L)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=3}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:149})
\par
"The zenith angle of a profile is defined as DφL = 90o−DβL, where DβL is the maximum elevation angle in DSL. Similarly, the nadir angle of a profile is defined as DψL = 90o−DδL , where DδL is the minimum elevation angle in DSL. Thus, the zenith angle is an angle between the zenith and the lineof-sight, and the nadir angle is an angle between the nadir and a hypothetical line-of-sight resulting from reflecting an elevation profile with respect to the horizontal plane." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=3}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:149})
\par
"There are two free parameters in the above formula, one is the lookup distance L and the other is theflatness threshold t." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=3}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:149})
\par
"The advantage of using a line-of-sight based neighborhood instead of a grid-based neighborhood in calculating ternary patterns becomes clear by observing that, in principle, choosing an infinitely large value of L should result in identification of landform element regardless of its scale" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=3}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:149})
\par
"The values ofΔs at point A are both negative, indicating a peak or a ridge, whereas the values ofΔs at point B are both positive, indicating a pit or a valley. Note that if we only use zenith angles to determineΔ, the absolute values ofΔs at point A would be very small— below theflatness threshold— indicatingflat terrain. This is because, in this particular terrain configuration, the line-of sight from a ground level at point A is determined by an immediate neighborhood. Using both zenith and nadir angles in our criterion eliminates such problems." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=3}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:149})
\par
"Considering that our LTPs have 8 slots each, there are 38=6561 theoretically possible different patterns. However, many of them are the result of either rotation or reflection of other patterns, so eliminating such multiples we end up with a set of 498 patterns. As previously noticed, we refer to these patterns as geomorphons." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=3}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:149})
\par
"We scan a DEM cell-by-cell; at each cell we calculate values of DΔL for all eight principal directions. These values are inserted into equation (1) to obtain a ternary pattern and a decimal label of the pattern is stored in the cell corresponding to its location" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=3}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:149})
\par
"Moreover, the abundances of different geomorphons are very uneven; the 30 most common geomorphons account for 85\% of all cells. The resulting landform element classification and its corresponding map is useful for tasks such as querying specific landform types in a study area" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=3}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:149})
\par
"This is achieved by grouping geomorphons into classes that correspond to the most commonly recognizable landform elements." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=3}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:149})
\par
"Note that these common geomorphons are characterized by a low number of transitions between ternary elements (1, 0,−1) in their patterns. This reflects relatively high degree of terrain autocorrelation (Fisher, 1998) even at the local scale." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=4}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:150})
\par
"In order to create a geomorphometric map containing the top 10 most commonly recognizable geomorphons in an exclusive and exhaustive fashion we need to reclassify the whole set of 498 geomorphons into 10 selected forms" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=4}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:150})
\par
"We have chosen a reclassification formula based on a particular lookup table constructed on the basis of similarity between ternary patterns representing the geomorphons; patterns are similar if they have similar number of different ternary elements." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=4}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:150})
\par
"rows indicate the number of (−1) elements in the pattern and columns indicate the number of (1) elements in the pattern." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=4}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:150})
\par
"The method is implemented as GRASSGIS (Neteler and Mitasova, 2007) extension r.geomorphon (requires GRASS v.7) and is written in ANSI C utilizing GRASS API. The GRASS GIS platform was chosen because: (a) it is open source software, (b) it makes working with very large datasets (even in excess of available RAM) possible, (c) it allows onthe-fly calculation of true geodesic distances in a latitude-longitude projection." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=4}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:150})
\par
"As mentioned in Section 1, most methods for the automated mapping of landform elements rely on differential geometry. In such methods a landform element of a local surface is determined from the signs and values of the slope and curvature of a surface (Dikau et al., 1995; Wood, 1996)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=5}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:151})
\par
"This popular method is sufficient for relatively small rasters, but its computational efficiency is too low for its application to giga-cell DEMs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=5}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:151})
\par
"These inefficiencies stem from the following: (a) a necessity to calculate quadratic approximation to the surface at each cell; (b) relatively complex algorithm for assignment of all major landform elements; (c) a necessity to apply a multi-scale approach" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=5}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:151})
\par
"The geomorphons-based method does not have such built-in computational inefficiencies and can be used for classification of giga-cell DEMs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=5}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:151})
\par
"We calculated the two curvature-based classification schemes using the GRASS module r.param.scale which is based on work by Wood (Wood, 1996)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=5}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:151})
\par
"This module implements Wood's classification scheme directly. The Dikau's scheme was implemented using profile and cross-sectional curvatures as calculated by r.param.scale." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=5}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:151})
\par
"Of course, it is possible to merge (Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004) Wood's and Dikau's classification schemes into a single scheme showing all 15 landform types. However, in order to perform such merged scheme, Schmidt and Hewitt had to resort to fuzzy classification technique (at high computational cost) to take into account considerable uncertainty in the slope tolerance parameter." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=5}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:151})
\par
"An important issue encountered during the auto-extraction of landform elements using differential geometry is the problem of length scale (Wood, 1996; Dragut et al., 2009; MacMillan and Shary, 2009). Landforms occur on variety of different scales and are frequently nested." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=5}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:151})
\par
"However, a calculation of geomorphometric variables requires a use of "window"— a square neighborhood around the focus cell over which a quadratic function isfitted to the elevation values" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=5}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:151})
\par
"A change in window size results in a different map. In order to address this problem Wood (2002), Fisher et al. (2004), and Schmidt and Hewitt (2004) proposed to use a variety of different window sizes and to assign a dominant landform type to each cell." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=6}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:152})
\par
"From a computational point of view this is a very inefficient solution as it requires a calculation of multiple maps (each one at a different scale) before thefinal map can be obtained." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=6}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:152})
\par
"The geomorphons method does not use afixed-size neighborhood, instead the size and the shape of a neighborhood from which the landform element is determined adjusts automatically to the geometry of the local terrain (see Section 2.1). This allows our method to determine the most appropriate landform element (and its scale) in a single scan of a DEM." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=6}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:152})
\par
"A desirable property of geomorphons method is that maps created with different values of lookup distance L quickly converge with increasing value of L." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=6}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:152})
\par
"This means that although L is a free parameter, it can be set to an optimal value (this value may depend on the resolution of the original DEM and spatial variability of landform scales across its extent) which is large enough to map landforms at most relevant scales but small enough for rapid computations (increasing the value of L increases computational cost)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=6}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:152})
\par
"The value of L determines the maximum scale at which we canfind the landform element; it needs to be set to a relatively large value in order for the map to show landform elements at a broad range of scales" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=6}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:152})
\par
"It is clear that L=20 cells is sufficient to map this particular type of landscape at that resolution; further increasing the" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=6}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:152})
\par
"value of L would increase the cost of calculation without meaningful change to the map." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=7}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:153})
\par
"There is no equivalent "optimal" window size for the methods based on differential geometry; increasing the window size completely changes the character of the map (Fig. 8), so the only way to get a multi-resolution map is to follow a computationally costly multi-window approach (Wood, 2002; Fisher et al., 2004; Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004). Note, however, that even the multi-window approach does not guarantee a unique map as the result may depend on a particular choice of window sizes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=7}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:153})
\par
"Geomorphons offer a novel perspective on how to approach quantitative terrain analysis." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=8}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:154})
\par
"The method grew from our desire to develop a robust and computationally efficient tool for classification of landforms from giga-cell DEMs. It became clear that standard methods, based on geomorphometric variables, fall short of the computational efficiency required to tackle such large DEMs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=8}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:154})
\par
"Geomorphons represent a paradigm shift in DEM classification" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=8}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:154})
\par
"In the machine vision approach the landforms are identified holistically from the pattern of a local terrain." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=9}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:155})
\par
"The key breakthrough was the realization that afinite number of elementary patterns is sufficient to encapsulate all possible forms of terrain. Another breakthrough was the realization that a local elementary form can be determined at a locally optimal spatial scale." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=9}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:155})
\par
"Scale self-adaptation contributes to computational efficiency because only a single scan of the DEM is required to detect landforms at a range of spatial scales. In this paper we have described the details of geomorphons method and demonstrated its advantages in terms of robustness as well as in terms of computational efficiency." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=9}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:155})

"Furthermore, a combination of lookup and exclusion distances can be used to identify only landform elements at narrowly defined spatial scales." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MQHS966U?page=9}{Jasiewicz et al 2013:155})

  abstract = {Geospatial Pattern Analysis Toolbox (GeoPAT) is a collection of GRASS GIS modules for carrying out pattern-based geospatial analysis of images and other spatial datasets. The need for pattern-based analysis arises when images/rasters contain rich spatial information either because of their very high resolution or their very large spatial extent. Elementary units of pattern-based analysis are scenes –patches of surface consisting of a complex arrangement of individual pixels (patterns). GeoPAT modules implement popular GIS algorithms, such as query, overlay, and segmentation, to operate on the grid of scenes. To achieve these capabilities GeoPAT includes a library of scene signatures – compact numerical descriptors of patterns, and a library of distance functions – providing numerical means of assessing dissimilarity between scenes. Ancillary GeoPAT modules use these functions to construct a grid of scenes or to assign signatures to individual scenes having regular or irregular geometries. Thus GeoPAT combines knowledge retrieval from patterns with mapping tasks within a single integrated GIS environment. GeoPAT is designed to identify and analyze complex, highly generalized classes in spatial datasets. Examples include distinguishing between different styles of urban settlements using VHR images, delineating different landscape types in land cover maps, and mapping physiographic units from DEM. The concept of pattern-based spatial analysis is explained and the roles of all modules and functions are described. A case study example pertaining to delineation of landscape types in a subregion of NLCD is given. Performance evaluation is included to highlight GeoPAT's applicability to very large datasets. The GeoPAT toolbox is available for download from http://sil.uc.edu/.},

  abstract = {Analyzing large Earth Observation (EO) data on the broad spatial scales frequently involves regionalization of patterns. To automate this process we present a segmentation algorithm designed specifically to delineate segments containing quasi-stationary patterns. The algorithm is designed to work with patterns of a categorical variable. This makes it possible to analyze very large spatial datasets (for example, a global land cover) in their entirety. An input categorical raster is first tessellated into small square tiles to form a new, coarser, grid of tiles. A mosaic of categories within each tile forms a local pattern, and the segmentation algorithm partitions the grid of tiles while maintaining the cohesion of pattern in each segment. The algorithm is based on the principle of seeded region growing (SRG) but it also includes segment merging and other enhancements to segmentation quality. Our key contribution is an extension of the concept of segmentation to grids in which each cell has a non-negligible size and contains a complex data structure (histograms of pattern features). Specific modification of a standard SRG algorithm include: working in a distance space with complex data objects, introducing sixconnected “brick wall” topology of the grid to decrease artifacts associated with tessellation of geographical space, constructing the SRG priority queue of seeds on the basis of local homogeneity of patterns, and using a content-dependent value of segment-growing threshold. The detailed description of the algorithm is given followed by an assessment of its performance on test datasets representing three pertinent themes of land cover, topography, and a high-resolution image. Pattern-based segmentation algorithm will find application in ecology, forestry, geomorphology, land management, and agriculture. The algorithm is implemented as a module of GeoPAT – an already existing, open source toolbox for performing pattern-based analysis of categorical rasters.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the classification problem with imperfect data. More precisely, it extends standard decision trees to handle uncertainty in both building and classification procedures. Uncertainty here is represented by means of possibility distributions. The first part investigates the issue of building decision trees from data with uncertain class values by developing a non-specificity based gain ratio as the attribute selection measure which, in our case, is more appropriate than the standard gain ratio based on Shannon entropy. The proposed non-specificity based possibilistic decision tree (NS-PDT) approach is then extended by considering another kind of uncertainty inherent in the building procedure. The extended approach so-called non-specificity based possibilistic option decision tree (NS-PODT) offers a more flexible building procedure by allowing the selection of more than one attribute in each node. The second part addresses the classification phase. More specifically, it investigates the issue of predicting the class value of new instances presented with certain and/or uncertain attribute values. Finally, we have developed a possibilistic decision tree toolbox (PD2T) in order to show the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Terrain positions are widely used to describe the Earth’s topographic features and play an important role in the studies of landform evolution, soil erosion and hydrological modeling. This work develops a new multimodal classification system with enhanced classification performance by integrating different approaches for terrain position identification. The adopted classification approaches include local terrain attribute (LA)-based and regional terrain attribute (RA)-based, rule-based and supervised, and pixel-based and object-oriented methods. Firstly, a double-level definition scheme is presented for terrain positions. Then, utilizing a hierarchical framework, a multimodal approach is developed by integrating different classification techniques. Finally, an assessment method is established to evaluate the new classification system from different aspects. The experimental results, obtained at a Loess Plateau region in northern China on a 5 m digital elevation model (DEM), show reasonably positional relationship, and larger inter-class and smaller intra-class variances. This indicates that identified terrain positions are consistent with the actual topography from both overall and local perspectives, and have relatively good integrity and rationality. This study demonstrates that the current multimodal classification system, developed by taking advantage of various classification methods, can reflect the geographic meanings and topographic features of terrain positions from different levels.},

  abstract = {The knowledge of the soil variability is essential for its hydrologic characterization, for irrigation management and planning and especially for water movement modeling. Nevertheless, the scarcity of soil information in Spain precludes its use in irrigation management and, particularly, in the on-going irrigation modernization process. The Violada Irrigation District (VID) comprises 5234 ha and is located in a semi-arid gypsum-rich region in northeast Spain. VID has been under flood irrigation since the mid-20th Century and has been modernized recently to sprinkler irrigation. Since the early 1980s water balances in VID have been based on average soil properties and bulk irrigation data. The current irrigation system provides detailed irrigation data at plot level, thus allowing for performing distributed balances (in hydrologic homogenous zones) that require detailed or semi-detailed soil information in the form of a soil map. The objective of this two-part study is to define homogeneous zones in relation to hydrological properties relevant for irrigation management, first defining the soil variability within the VID and then analyzing the soils hydrologic and salinity features (in a companion paper). The specific objectives of this paper were (i) to draw the VID semi-detailed soil map; (ii) to explain the variability of soil properties; and (iii) to map the main soil characteristics related to irrigation management. Thirty four soil pits, located on all the different geomorphological areas, were opened and described. Samples were taken from all the horizons and analyzed for chemical and physical properties. The limits of soil units were drawn with the aid of 32 additional auger holes, the data from 72 pits opened during the irrigation transformation works, and all the previous soil information available. Finally the soils were classified down to family level. The main soil formation processes in VID were carbonation and gypsification. Thirteen soil units were defined, included in five soil subgroups and six particle size families. “Fine” particle sizes were dominant along the gypsum-rich valley bottoms. Coarser textures were found on the heights and showed higher CaCO3 equivalent content and no presence of gypsum accumulations. A priori, the main limitation for irrigation in the valley soils was the limited drainage (due to fine textures and reduced slope) while in the highland soils it might be constrained by their low retention capacity. The high gypsum and carbonate content of the VID soils may prevent the development of infiltration problems. The soil properties map in this work will be the basis for a companion paper delineating the hydrologic properties of the soils, the basis for improved soil water balances.},

\par
"First, let us mention some typical characteristics of geospatial phenomena and environmental data: nonlinearity (linear models have limited applicability); spatial and temporal non-stationarity, i.e. in many cases hypotheses of spatio-temporal stationarity (second-order stationarity, intrinsic hypotheses) can not be accepted; multi-scale variability (high variability at several geographical scales), presence of noise and extremes/outliers; multivariate nature, etc" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AGZZD6L8?page=2}{Kanevski et al 2008:2})
\par
"These "particularities" violate applications of traditional methods (including many geostatistical models) and highly complicates analysis, modelling and visualisation of geoand environmental data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AGZZD6L8?page=2}{Kanevski et al 2008:2})

\par
"In machine learning there are several approaches for hyperparameters tuning, e.g. splitting of data, cross-validations, etc. For geospatial data geostatistical tools, for example, variography is a valuable tool to control the quality of machine learning procedures and parameters tuning" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AGZZD6L8?page=2}{Kanevski et al 2008:2})

"Quantitative analysis of monitoring networks using topological, statistical and fractal measures helps to describe data representativity, to remove biases in modelling distributions and to select declustering procedures" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AGZZD6L8?page=3}{Kanevski et al 2008:3})

  abstract = {This paper proposes a method for mapping depth functions of soil organic matter (SOM) that combines general pedological knowledge with geostatistical modeling. A pedometric soil map that represents soil type at any location with a probability distribution formed the starting-point. For each of the ten soil types depicted on this map a depth function structure was defined that describes the variation of SOM over depth based on pedological knowledge about soil profile morphology. To this end five depth function building blocks were defined, referred to as ‘model horizons’. For each soil type the depth function structure was obtained by stacking a subset of model horizons. The parameters of the ten soil type–specific depth functions were calibrated with data from soil profile descriptions and spatially interpolated using environmental covariates as predictors. The predicted parameters and the soil-type specific depth function structures then allowed us to construct the depth function of SOM for each soil type at each prediction site. By combining the soil type–specific depth functions with the probability distributions of the soil types, a probability distribution of depth functions was obtained at each location in the study area. The soil type–specific depth functions and their associated probabilities were used to map the SOM stock for depth intervals 0–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–90 cm, and 0–90 cm. The mapped SOM stocks were validated with an independent probability sample. R2-values ranged between 0.09 and 0.75, with 0.46 for the 0–90 cm layer. The RSME was largest for the 30–60 cm layer (13.4 kg/m2). This is typically the layer with the largest within-soil type and between-soil type variation of SOM and is therefore the most challenging to predict. Similar to other studies better predictions were found for the top layer than for subsurface layers, which illustrates a general challenge of capturing subsurface variation of soil properties by our pedometric models. The pedometric approach to three-dimensional mapping of SOM presented in this paper is closely related to the conventional approach that represents depth distribution of soil properties with representative profile descriptions that are associated to the map units of a soil type map. A comparison of our pedometric approach with the conventional approach showed that there was little difference in performance. However, our modeled depth functions might give a more realistic representation of the vertical variation than the discrete (stepped) functions based on representative soil profile descriptions and thus might provide better predictions of the SOM content at small depth intervals.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a pedometric approach to updating the Dutch 1:50,000 national soil map for the peatlands, and illustrates this approach for a 187,525 ha area in the northern peatlands. This is the first time that digital soil mapping replaces conventional soil mapping in a nationwide, government-funded soil survey program in the Netherlands. Soil classes were updated indirectly through mapping two quantitative diagnostic soil properties: the thickness and starting depth of the peat layer. From these, five major soil groups could be constructed. Because the point data were zero-inflated, a two-step simulation approach was implemented. First, peat presence/absence indicators were simulated from probabilities of peat occurrence that were predicted with a generalized linear model. Second, conditional peat thickness values were simulated from kriging with external drift predictions. The indicator and peat thickness simulations were combined to obtain simulations of the unconditional peat thickness. A similar approach was followed for the starting depth. From the simulated soil properties, probability distributions of soil groups were derived. These groups were refined with information on (static) soil properties derived from the 1:50,000 map to obtain soil classes according to the 1:50,000 legend. The updated raster map was then incorporated in the 1:50,000 polygon map. The prediction models were calibrated with legacy point data, that were updated for peat thickness before being used, in addition to a set of newly acquired point data. The uncertainty associated to the updated peat thickness values in the legacy dataset was quantified and accounted for by the prediction models. The peat thickness map and a map with three soil orders were validated with independent probability sample data. The overall purity of the soil order map was 66\% for both subareas. For subarea 1 this was a 12\% purity improvement compared to the current 1:50,000 map, for subarea 2 this was 3\%. For subarea 1, the mean absolute error of the predicted peat thickness was 23.5 cm, and the R2 is 0.50. For subarea 2 these accuracy measures were 30.9 cm and 0.65. We conclude that nationwide updating the 1:50,000 map with pedometric techniques is feasible. In order to increase the value and usability of the legacy point data as well as the large set of newly acquired field observations and the updated 1:50,000 map, we recommend installation of a soil monitoring network in the Dutch peatlands.},

  abstract = {Legacy data in the form of soil maps, which often have typical property measurements associated with each polygon, can be an important source of information for digital soil mapping (DSM). Methods of disaggregating such information and using it for quantitative estimation of soil properties by methods such as regression kriging (RK) are needed. Several disaggregation processes have been investigated; preferred methods include those which include consideration of scorpan factors and those which are mass preserving (pycnophylactic) making transitions between different scales of investigation more theoretically sound. Area to point kriging (AtoP kriging) is pycnophylactic and here we investigate its merits for disaggregating legacy data from soil polygon maps. Area to point regression kriging (AtoP RK) which incorporates ancillary data into the disaggregation process was also applied. The AtoP kriging and AtoP RK approaches do not involve collection of new soil measurements and are compared with disaggregation by simple rasterization. Of the disaggregation methods investigated, AtoP RK gave the most accurate predictions of soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations (smaller mean absolute errors (MAEs) of cross-validation) for disaggregation of soil polygon data across the whole of Northern Ireland.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) increasingly makes use of machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between soil properties and multiple covariates that can be detected across landscapes. Selecting the appropriate algorithm for model building is critical for optimizing results in the context of the available data. Over the past decade, many studies have tested different machine learning (ML) approaches on a variety of soil data sets. Here, we review the application of some of the most popular ML algorithms for digital soil mapping. Specifically, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), Cubist, random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for DSM. These algorithms were compared on the basis of five factors: (1) quantity of hyperparameters, (2) sample size, (3) covariate selection, (4) learning time, and (5) interpretability of the resulting model. If training time is a limitation, then algorithms that have fewer model parameters and hyperparameters should be considered, e.g., MLR, KNN, SVR, and Cubist. If the data set is large (thousands of samples) and computation time is not an issue, ANN would likely produce the best results. If the data set is small ({$<$}100), then Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR are likely to perform better than ANN and MLR. The uncertainty in predictions produced by Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR may not decrease with large datasets. When interpretability of the resulting model is important to the user, Cubist, MLR, and RF are more appropriate algorithms as they do not function as “black boxes.” There is no one correct approach to produce models for predicting the spatial distribution of soil properties. Nonetheless, some algorithms are more appropriate than others considering the nature of the data and purpose of mapping activity.},

  abstract = {Digital soil assessment (DSA) is the application of interpretations to digital soil mapping (DSM). Since 2010, an operational DSA program has been underway in Tasmania, Australia, primarily for the assessment of agricultural land suitability for 20 different crops in newly commissioned irrigation schemes. This involves development of functional soil attribute and climate grids, initially undertaken in two pilot areas totalling 70,000 ha, with comprehensive soil sampling and temperature sensor networks. Through the Tasmanian State Government ‘Water for Profit Program’, this pilot land resource assessment has become operational and applied to the entire State (68,401 km2), covering a total of 19 irrigation schemes. Using a combination of newly collected and legacy soil data and a suite of spatial explanatory covariates, a total of 218 80 m resolution 3D soil attribute grids were produced using the digital mapping approach, together with quantified prediction uncertainties. These grids have contributed to the ‘Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia’ and the ‘GlobalSoilMap’ projects. Using a similar approach, functional climate grids were generated for chill-hours, growing degree-days and frost risk. The digital soil and climate grids were applied to pre-defined enterprise suitability rulesets to produce 20 different maps of enterprise suitability, including opium poppies, and a range of perennial horticultural, cereal and vegetable crops, uploaded to a publically accessible spatial internet portal (Land Information Services Tasmania; LISTmap), which includes functionality to identify soil and climate limitations, as an indication of potential land management inputs. The suitability surfaces provide a regional indication of potential areas to expand or diversify into a range of cropping enterprises. However, some informative supplementary products were also developed to provide an overall spatial guide to the more versatile agricultural areas. This included an enterprise versatility index (by combining all suitability surfaces to identify areas more suited to more enterprises); and application of individual commodity ‘financial gross-margins’ to identify the highest-valued agricultural land in terms of earning potential. These products demonstrate the utility of functional soil property grids and the collective capacity of DSA to answer questions of agricultural potential; this can ensure the appropriate land is targeted for appropriate uses to stimulate agricultural markets and maintain food security.},

  abstract = {Soil Security is a holistic soil assessment approach that cogitates soil as a multi-dimensional medium. Rather than traditional single dimensional assessment approaches such as land capability mapping that largely considers only soil and landscape biophysical attributes, the Soil Security concept considers social aspects, education, policy, legislation, current land use, condition and the soils natural and economic value to society. It can identify discrete soils that are currently being used within their capacity, and areas where a use might be unsustainable, i.e. not secure. It would therefore make sense to map this concept, which aligns well with the aspirational and marketing policies of the Tasmanian Government, where increased agricultural expansion through new irrigation schemes and multiple-use State managed production forests co-exists beside pristine World Heritage conservation land, a major drawcard of the economically important tourism industry. The spatial quantification of soil security is seen as an emerging tool to effectively protect the soil resource in terms of food and water security, biodiversity maintenance and safeguarding fragile ecosystems. The recent development and application of Digital Soil Mapping and Assessment capacities in Tasmania to stimulate agricultural production and better target appropriate soil resource use has formed the foundational system that can enable the first efforts in quantifying and mapping Soil Security, in particular the five Soil Security dimensions (Capability, Condition, Capital, Codification and Connectivity). This forms a preliminary mapping product that demonstrates the feasibility of mapping the Soil Security concept. To provide a measure of overall soil security, it was necessary to separately assess the State’s three major soil uses; Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. These outputs provide an indication of where different activities are sustainable or at risk, where more soil data is needed, and develops a tool to better plan for a State requiring optimal food and fibre production, without depleting its natural soil resources and impacting the fragile ecosystems providing environmental benefits and supporting the tourism industry. The following paper demonstrates why and how we might map Soil Security, describing a preliminary approach to mapping the separate dimensions; this approach could be adapted and applied elsewhere as an evaluation tool to identify soil threats relevant to current land use, biophysical properties, policy and management, and stimulate further research and debate into developing a global Soil Security mapping methodology.},

Analysis and classification of remotely sensed spectral data is an effective method for discerning the spatial and temporal variability of soils. The East Shore Area (ESA) of the Great Salt Lake soil survey update is focused on updating soil map units containing wet and saline soils. The ESA provides a unique environment for the use of remotely sensed spectral data for map unit refinement because of low relief and a large extent of soils that are wet and saline to various degrees. Map units in the ESA containing wet and saline soils were updated and refined using Landsat 7 imagery. Five land-cover classes are related to dominant soil types that vary in soil wetness, salinity, calcium carbonate concentration and vegetation cover type. Supervised classification of the imagery was performed using the five land cover classes. The final classification resulted in 14 land cover classes, including nine additional classes that help describe the variability in the original five classes. The classification results were validated using visual inspection in the field, a priori knowledge of the area and an error matrix. The results of the classification were used to enhance original soil map units and calculate map unit composition in the final soil mapping process. This information was then incorporated into the updated soil map. Temporal variation in land cover classes has the potential to be considered in map-unit refinement to reflect the dynamic nature of the margins of the Great Salt Lake, Utah.},

In this paper the quality of DEMs derived from the interpolation of photogrammetrically derived elevation points in Alberta, Canada, is tested. DEMs with grid cell sizes ranging from 100 to 5 m were interpolated from 100 m regularly spaced elevation points and numerous surface-specific point elevations using the ANUDEM interpolation method. In order to identify the grid resolution that matches the information content of the source data, three approaches were applied: density analysis of point elevations, an analysis of cumulative frequency distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the root mean square slope measure. Results reveal that the optimum grid cell size is between 5 and 20 m, depending on terrain complexity and terrain derivative. Terrain variables based on 100 m regularly sampled elevation points are compared to an independent high-resolution DEM used as a benchmark. Subsequent correlation analysis reveals that only elevation and local slope have a strong positive relationship while all other terrain derivatives are not represented realistically when derived from a coarse DEM. Calculations of root mean square errors and relative root mean square errors further quantify the quality of terrain derivatives.},

Relief requires linear time in the number of given features and the number of training instances regardless of the target concept to be learned. Although the algorithm does not necessarily find the smallest subset of features, the size tends to be small because only statistically relevant features are selected. This paper focuses on empirical test results in two artificial domains; the LED Display domain and the Parity domain with and without noise. Comparison with other feature selection algorithms shows Relief's advantages in terms of learning time and the accuracy of the learned concept, suggesting Relief's practicality.},

  abstract = {Soil degradation is a critical and growing global problem. As the world population increases, pressure on soil also increases and the natural capital of soil faces continuing decline. International policy makers have recognized this and a range of initiatives to address it have emerged over recent years. However, a gap remains between what the science tells us about soil and its role in underpinning ecological and human sustainable development, and existing policy instruments for sustainable development. Functioning soil is necessary for ecosystem service delivery, climate change abatement, food and fiber production and fresh water storage. Yet key policy instruments and initiatives for sustainable development have under-recognized the role of soil in addressing major challenges including food and water security, biodiversity loss, climate change and energy sustainability. Soil science has not been sufficiently translated to policy for sustainable development. Two underlying reasons for this are explored and the new concept of soil security is proposed to bridge the science–policy divide. Soil security is explored as a conceptual framework that could be used as the basis for a soil policy framework with soil carbon as an exemplar indicator.},

  abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values.},

  abstract = {There is a need for cheap methods for digital soil mapping on intermediate scales that make optimal use of existing multi-source datasets on both general and detailed scales. Apart from the spatial challenges that often have to be faced in map integration the semantics of datasets have to be well understood for successful data integration. So-called ‘‘ontology-based’’ approaches for the semantic integration of multi-source geographical datasets may be used to give a firm conceptual basis to digital soil mapping from multiscale, multi-source geographic data. This chapter explores the use of ontologies in semantic data integration. A first version of an approach for ontology-based data integration for soil-landscape mapping is presented consisting of semantic factoring, ontology definition, reference model construction and data integration. This approach is illustrated with the semantic integration of a small-scale (1:400,000) soil-geomorphic map with a geological map at 1:50,000 scale of the Antequera area in Spain. Comparison of the results of our approach to semantic integration with an Antequera geo-pedological legend designed to map soil-landforms in this area at 1:50,000 scale shows a clear correspondence of ontologies.},

  abstract = {A machine learning system (MART) has been used to predict soil parent material (SPM) at the regional scale with a 50-m resolution. The use of point-specific soil observations as training data was tested as a replacement for the soil maps introduced in previous studies, with the aim of generating a more even distribution of training data over the study area and reducing information uncertainty. The 27,020-km2 study area (Brittany, northwestern France) contains mainly metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary substrates. However, superficial deposits (aeolian loam, colluvial and alluvial deposits) very often represent the actual SPM and are typically under-represented in existing geological maps. In order to calibrate the predictive model, a total of 4920 point soil descriptions were used as training data along with 17 environmental predictors (terrain attributes derived from a 50-m DEM, as well as emissions of K, Th and U obtained by means of airborne gamma-ray spectrometry, geological variables at the 1:250,000 scale and land use maps obtained by remote sensing). Model predictions were then compared: i) during SPM model creation to point data not used in model calibration (internal validation), ii) to the entire point dataset (point validation), and iii) to existing detailed soil maps (external validation). The internal, point and external validation accuracy rates were 56\%, 81\% and 54\%, respectively. Aeolian loam was one of the three most closely predicted substrates. Poor prediction results were associated with uncommon materials and areas with high geological complexity, i.e. areas where existing maps used for external validation were also imprecise. The resultant predictive map turned out to be more accurate than existing geological maps and moreover indicated surface deposits whose spatial coverage is consistent with actual knowledge of the area. This method proves quite useful in predicting SPM within areas where conventional mapping techniques might be too costly or lengthy or where soil maps are insufficient for use as training data. In addition, this method allows producing repeatable and interpretable results, whose accuracy can be assessed objectively.},

  abstract = {Given the relative dearth of, and the huge demand for, quantitative spatial soil information, it is timely to develop and implement methodologies for its provision. We suggest that digital soil mapping, which can be defined as the creation, and population of spatial soil information systems (SSINFOS) by the use of field and laboratory observational methods, coupled with spatial and non-spatial soil inference systems, is the appropriate response. Problems of large extents and soil-cover complexity and coarse resolutions and short-range variability representation carry over from conventional soil survey to digital soil mapping. Meeting users’ requests and demands and the ability to deal with spatially variable and temporally evolving datasets must be the key features of any new approach. In this chapter, we present a generic framework that recognises the procedures required. Within quantitatively defined physiographic regions, SSINFOS must be populated and spatial soil inference systems (SSINFERS) must be developed. When combined this will allow users to derive the data they require. Further work is required on the development of these systems, and on the data requirements, the optimal forms of inference and the appropriate representation of the products of digital soil mapping.},

  abstract = {Soil sodicity, generally measured through the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), is the most prevalent edaphic stress in Australia, particularly in the northern grains-growing region (NGR) of Australia. Farmers, scientists and policy-makers need accurate maps of sodicity for environmental modelling, and to make rational decisions for management. A common approach to mapping soil properties for multiple target depths is to first harmonize soil profile data to the target depth intervals, usually through equal-area spline functions, then undertake a two-dimensional spatial analysis (often regression kriging) for each interval; we refer to this as a ‘spline-then-krige’ (STK) approach. An alternative is to calibrate a single three-dimensional model that describes soil variation both horizontally and vertically, as is done in the increment-averaged kriging (IAK) approach. This study compares IAK and STK for mapping ESP in the NGR. A machine-learning algorithm was used to model trends based on environmental covariates in both approaches. Both IAK and STK captured the ESP variation reasonably well (concordance correlation coefficient values for IAK around 0.5 for all depths), with IAK giving slightly better predictive accuracies for all depths, most evidently in the topsoil. IAK allows the natural use of all available data, explicitly accounts for the sample support of the soil data and the horizontal and vertical autocorrelation between and within soil profiles, and enables the propagation of uncertainty from the original data through to the final predictions and prediction uncertainties. We conclude that IAK can provide a competitive alternative to STK approaches for mapping soil properties in three dimensions.},

  abstract = {Optical remote sensing can provide a synoptic view of grapevine photosynthetically-active biomass over entire vineyards both rapidly and cost-effectively. Such output offers viticulturists and winemakers a management tool of enormous potential with red grape varieties, especially if canopy architecture (defined in this way) can be linked to production of phenolics and colour in ripe grapes. Accordingly, this paper describes such associations for a Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard in Australia’s cool-climate Coonawarra region. A link is established between physical descriptors of grapevine canopies (derived from remotely-sensed images), and subsequent measurements of grape phenolics and colour. Highresolution images were acquired on three occasions during each of two consecutive growing seasons and post-processed to a range of on-ground resolutions. The strength of correlation between those images and berry properties (both total phenolics, and colour levels at harvest), varied according to spatial resolution and vine phenology at the time of imaging. An image resolution corresponding approximately to row spacing resulted in the strongest correlations between berry constituents and image-based data on all occasions. Referenced to grapevine phenology, correlations were initially weak (insignificant) at budburst, reached maximum strength at veraison, then diminished somewhat as grapes ripened. Prospects for applying such remotely-sensed imagery (at an appropriate resolution and timing), to predict berry phenolics and colour at harvest, are discussed.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the current research and applications of various digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques used to map Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) concentration and stocks following a systematic mapping approach from 2013 until present (18 February 2019). It is intended that this review of relevant literature will assist prospective researchers by identifying knowledge clusters and gaps in relation to the digital mapping of SOC. Of 120 studies, most were clustered in some specific countries such as China, Australia and the USA. The highest number publications were in 2016 and 2017. Regarding the predictive models, there was a progression from Linear Models towards Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and hybrid models in Regression Kriging (RK) framework performed better than individual models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was the most frequently used method for predicting SOC, although it was outperformed by other ML techniques in most studies. Random Forest (RF) was found to perform better than MLR and other ML techniques in most comparative studies. Other common and competitive techniques were Cubist, Neural Network (NN), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Due to the inconsistency in various comparative studies, it would be advisable to calibrate the competitive algorithms using specific experimental datasets. This review also reveals the environmental covariates that have been identified as the most important by RF technique in recent years in regard to digital mapping of SOC, which may assist in selecting optimum sets of environmental covariates for mapping SOC. Covariates representing organism/organic activities were among the most frequent among top five covariates, followed by the variables representing climate and topography. Climate was reported to be influential in determining the variation in SOC level at regional scales, followed by parent materials, topography and land use. However, for mapping at a resolution that represents smaller areas such as a farm- or plot-scale, land use and vegetation indices were stated to be more influential in predicting SOC. Furthermore, unlike a previous review work, all recent studies in this review incorporated validation and 41\% of them estimated spatially explicit prediction of uncertainty. Only 9.16\% studies performed external validation, whereas most studies used data-splitting and cross-validation techniques which may not be the best options for datasets obtained through non-probability sampling.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) depends on the identification of relationships between soil variables and informative covariates. These have components of variation that correspond to different spatial scales, so an analysis of variation by spatial scale may be both informative and of practical value for improving predictions of soil properties. In this chapter multiresolution analysis on wavelet basis functions is explained and illustrated, using both continuous variables and indicator variables defined on soil classes. A case study is presented in which a decomposition of sensor data on soil electrical conductivity resulted in better predictive models for soil properties. The use of wavelet methods for denoising data is illustrated. Because of the local properties of wavelet coefficients it is possible to smooth noise while retaining local variation at high spatial frequencies that appears to be significant. Finally, it is shown how wavelet packet transforms and bestbasis identification can be used to develop a wavelet basis that is adapted to the properties of a particular data set.},

However, while the practical advantages and disadvantages of various nested designs have been discussed, no attempt has been made to optimize nested sampling schemes. This paper shows how an optimal nested sampling design can be found by a method of numerical combinatorial optimization: simulated annealing. The sample design is optimized over a space of possible designs for a fixed sample size and predetermined levels (spatial scales). The objective function for optimization is based on the expected covariance matrix for errors in the estimates of variance components, and so depends on what those components are. By simulation it was shown that optimized sampling schemes can detect scale-dependent variance components with common requirements for statistical power on smaller total sample sizes than are required with commonly used spatially nested sample designs such as the balanced design. Although the optimized design depends on the underlying covariance structure, sampling designs can be identified that perform better than the commonly used ones over a wide range of conditions.},

We present simulated and experimental study in order to assess the effect of salinity on the complex permittivity of geological materials and, therefore, on the radar backscattering coefficient in the [1-7 GHz] frequency range. Laboratory measurements are performed on sand/sodium chloride aqueous mixtures using a vectorial network analyzer coupled to an open-ended coaxial dielectric probe. We aim at calibrating and validating semiempirical dielectric mixing models. In particular, we evaluated the dependence of the real and imaginary parts of complex permittivity on the microwave frequency, water content, and salinity. Our results confirm that if the real part is mainly affected by the moisture content, the imaginary part is more sensitive to salinity. In addition to the classic formulas of mixing models, the ionic-conductivity losses, which are due to mobile ions in the saline solution, are taken into account in order to better assess the effect of salinity on the dielectric properties of mixtures. Dielectric mixing models are then used as input parameters for the simulation of the radar backscattering coefficients by means of an analytical model: the integral equation model. Simulation results show that salinity should have a significant impact on the radar backscattering recorded in synthetic aperture radar data in terms of the magnitude of the backscattering coefficient. Moreover, our results suggest that VV polarization provides a greater sensitivity to salinity than HH polarization.},

The vineyards were divided into water status zones using geographic information systems to map the seasonal mean leaf water potential (Ψ) and cane pruning weight (vine size). Leaf Ψ zones were confirmed using k-means clustering. Both seasons were cooler and wetter than average and the range of leaf Ψ defining the water status zones was narrow (-0.59 to -0.95 MPa across all vineyards). Yield, vine size, crop load, anthocyanins, and phenols had the highest coefficients of variability. Higher yields, berry weights, titratable acidity, anthocyanins, and color were occasionally associated with low water status zones. There were no berry composition variables with differences between vine size zones in all four vineyards. Higher yields, cluster numbers, and berry weights were frequently associated with high vine size zones. Principal components analysis separated the vineyards but did not create clusters based on leaf Ψ or vine size. There were notable correlations between vineyard and grape composition variables, and spatial trends were qualitatively related for many of the variables. Significant r2 values that suggested inverse relationships were found in 2008 for leaf Ψ versus anthocyanins, color intensity, and phenols and for vine size versus anthocyanins, while in 2009 there were significant r2 values for soil moisture versus anthocyanins and color intensity that likewise suggested inverse relationships. This study showed that there is potential for using geomatic techniques to understand variability in vineyards, but that erratic weather in eastern North America presents a challenge for understanding the driving forces of such variability.},

There is a great deal more to remote sensing data than meets the eye, and extracting that information turns out to be a major computational challenge. For this purpose, high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure such as clusters, distributed networks or specialized hardware devices provide important architectural developments to accelerate the computations related with information extraction in remote sensing. In this paper, we review recent advances in HPC applied to remote sensing problems; in particular, the HPC-based paradigms included in this review comprise multiprocessor systems, large-scale and heterogeneous networks of computers, grid and cloud computing environments, and hardware systems such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Combined, these parts deliver a snapshot of the state-of-the-art and most recent developments in those areas, and offer a thoughtful perspective of the potential and emerging challenges of applying HPC paradigms to remote sensing problems.

The Africa Soil Profiles Database (AfSP), a compilation of georeferenced and standardised legacy soil profile data for Sub-Saharan Africa, was prepared within the context of the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project. It contains site and layer data for some 16,700 soil profiles, of which 93\% is georeferenced, for 38 countries. The average density of observations is 8.7 profiles per 10,000 km2, but the spatial distribution is uneven and varies per country and property from 0 to 255 per 10,000 km2. The median positional accuracy is 0.0023 decimal degrees or some 250 m at the equator.},

  abstract = {Geospatially explicit information of soil-landscape resources of Ethiopia is lacking or fragmented for much of the country. Recently, massive soil data were collected, however these are limited to properties related to soil fertility and valid for the topsoil only. Understanding the country’s soil-landscape resources, including their qualities and constraints beyond the topsoil, remains key information for systematic and reliable scaling up of evidence-based agricultural best practices including soil fertility management recommendations. The objective of this study was to produce a coherent dataset of the major soil-landscape resources of 30 highland woredas (districts), contributing to the Agricultural Growth Program of the Government of Ethiopia. The study started with an exploratory survey to identify the major (most common) soils occurring across the landscapes followed by a full survey to assess the distribution of the identified major soils. Representative soil profiles were characterised from soil pits and classified as Reference Soil Groups (RSGs), with prefix qualifiers (PQs), according to the World Reference Base for soil resources (WRB). A large number of soil profiles was classified from auger observations. Observed soil classes at both RSG and RSG + PQ level were combined with spatial explanatory variables (covariates), representing the soil forming factors in the landscapes, and their relationships were modelled and validated by random forest. A multitude of tree models was trained using each profile for calibration in approximately two third and cross-validation in approximately one third of the models. Cross-validation showed that RSGs were predicted with a reasonable overall purity of 0.58 and RSGs + PQ were predicted with a purity of 0.48. The most relevant covariate in the models was the Geomorphology and Soils map of Ethiopia at 1: 1 M scale disaggregated into soil-landscape facets. Next models were used to predict soil classes across woredas which resulted in a 250 m resolution raster map of the most probable major soils. This raster map was generalised into a polygon map of major soil-landscape resources. The purity of this final map was estimated to be 0.54 for RSGs and 0.45 for RSGs + PQ. Soil properties relevant for agricultural interpretation, such as depth, drainage, texture, pH, CEC and organic carbon and nutrient contents, were mapped according to the RSGs depicted on the soil-landscape resources map with a RMSE/mean ratio of on average 42\%. We conclude that soil expert knowledge and conventional soil-landscape survey combined with random forest modelling results in an attractive hybrid approach. The approach proves cost-effective and sufficiently accurate and can be used to inform scaling up of evidence-based agricultural best practices.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the R package PTAk and how the spatiotemporal context can be taken into account in the analyses. Essentially PTAk() is a multiway multidimensional method to decompose a multi-entries data-array, seen mathematically as a tensor of any order. This PTAk-modes method proposes a way of generalizing SVD (singular value decomposition), as well as some other well known methods included in the R package, such as PARAFAC or CANDECOMP and the PCAn-modes or Tucker-n model. The example datasets cover different domains with various spatio-temporal characteristics and issues: (i) medical imaging in neuropsychology with a functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) study, (ii) pharmaceutical research with a pharmacodynamic study with EEG (electro-encephaloegraphic) data for a central nervous system (CNS) drug, and (iii) geographical information system (GIS) with a climatic dataset that characterizes arid and semi-arid variations. All the methods implemented in the R package PTAk also support non-identity metrics, as well as penalizations during the optimization process. As a result of these flexibilities, together with pre-processing facilities, PTAk constitutes a framework for devising extensions of multidimensional methods such as correspondence analysis, discriminant analysis, and multidimensional scaling, also enabling spatio-temporal constraints.},

"However, soils with different names often have very similar characteristics, which is likely to lead to underestimation of model performance for predicting soil taxonomic groups. For this reason, some researchers have incorporated taxonomic distance into the evaluation routine for such models (Carré and Girard, 2002; Minasny and McBratney, 2007).

  abstract = {The GlobalSoilMap initiative calls for the generation of continuous maps for soil properties, including pH in a 1:5 suspension of soil in water (pH 1:5W) based on a standard method, ISO 10390. The United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) employs a 1:1 suspension of soil in water (pH 1:1W), and a 1:2 suspension of soil in CaCl2 (0.01 M) (pH 1:2CaCl2) for routine pH analysis (Soil Survey Staff, 2009). The objective of this study was to determine the most efficient way to convert these pH values to the GlobalSoilMap standard. For this analysis, 563 soil samples from the USDA-NRCS-National Soil Survey Center (NSSC) soil archive, which had been previously analysed for pH 1:1W and pH 1:2CaCl2, were selected for determination of pH 1:5W, pH 1:5CaCl2 and electrical conductivity (EC) in 1:2 suspension of soil in water (EC 1:2W). The samples represented 11 soil orders, 8 mineralogy classes, 5 family particle size classes, 4 genetic master horizons, and 7 depth intervals. For each category, 25–30 samples were selected to represent a comprehensive pH range. Regression analysis showed strong and significant relationships (R2 N 0.92) between pH methods across all categories. The simple linear regression equation, pH 1:5W = −0.51 + 1.06 pH 1:1W, had an RMSE = 0.44 pH units. Smoothing spline, did not significantly improve pH 1:5W predictions, nor did the incorporation of EC. Genetic horizons and soil depth intervals did not have a significant effect on pH 1:5W. The linear regression models for predicting pH 1:5W using pH 1:1W or pH 1:2CaCl2 as predictors emerged as the best candidates for a standard pedotransfer function. Using pedotransfer functions such as these will allow for the simple conversion of existing measured and estimated pH 1:1W or pH 1:2CaCl2 values from NRCS databases to the GlobalSoilMap standard of pH 1:5W.},

  abstract = {Predicting soil property distribution from a catena in the digital environment has been explored by many researchers with only slightly better than modest results. In this study, the landform recognition algorithm “geomorphons” in the GRASS GIS environment was explored to determine if this landscape model could improve predictions of soil properties. For 74 borings on the Wabash glacial moraine in Wells County, Indiana, measurements were made for: A horizon thickness, depth to chroma 2 features, effervescence, dense glacial till, carbonate concretions, and autochthonous platy structure. A digital elevation model (DEM) generated from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data was used for the study site. The geomorphons algorithm was used to generate 10 original landforms: “flat”, “footslope”, “summit”, “ridge”, “shoulder”, “spur”, “slope”, “hollow”, “valley”, and “depression” that were aggregated to new landforms coinciding with slope positions: “toeslope”, “footslope”, “backslope”, “shoulder”, “summit”, and “depression” recognized by soil surveyors. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Multinomial Logistics Regression Analysis (MLR) were used to aggregate the measured soil properties into the landform groups. The aggregation of geomorphons groups improved the MRL predictions to 83\% accuracy. Also, the aggregation of geomorphons to five landforms to predict soil property distribution on the landscape gave promising results for the low-relief and relatively flat area of northeast Indiana. To test if the true mean value of each soil property for each landform was reliable for generalizing population characteristics, relative standard error (RSE) was calculated as a proportion of standard error to population mean from a bootstrap estimation. The range of RSE values for all soil properties and landforms was between \textasciitilde 0.7\% and \textasciitilde 19\%. Since the estimates of the measured soil properties all have RSE values of less than 25\%, they can be considered reliable. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Better understanding the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is important for the management and enhancement of soils for production and environmental outcomes. We have applied digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to combine soil-site datasets from legacy and recent sources, environmental covariates and expert pedological knowledge to predict and map SOC stocks in the top 0.3 m, and their uncertainty, across South Australia’s agricultural zone. In achieving this, we aimed to maximise the use of locally sourced datasets not previously considered in national soil C assessments. Practical considerations for operationalising DSM are also discussed in the context of working with problematic legacy datasets, handling large numbers of potentially correlated covariates, and meeting end-user needs for readily interpretable results and accurate maps. Spatial modelling was undertaken using opensource R statistical software over a study area of \textasciitilde 160 000 km2. Legacy-site SOC stock estimates were derived with inputs from an expert-derived bulk-density pedotransfer function to overcome critical gaps in the data. Site estimates of SOC were evaluated over a consistent depth range and then used in spatial predictions through an environmentalcorrelation regression-kriging DSM approach. This used the contemporary Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator penalised-regression method, which catered for a large number (63 numeric, four categorical, four legacy-soil mapping themes) of potentially correlated covariates. For efficient use of the available data, this was performed within a k-fold cross-validation (k = 10) modelling framework. Through this, we generated multiple predictions and variance information at every node of our prediction grid, which was used to evaluate and map the expected value (mean) of SOC stocks and their uncertainty. For the South Australian agricultural zone, expected value SOC stocks in the top 0.3 m summed to 0.589 Gt with a 90\% prediction interval of 0.266–1.086 Gt.},

Representativeness of the sample concerning the population to be sampled needs to be guaranteed in any regression-based modelling approach. Four selected sampling designs were adapted to show that basically any design may be optimised to represent the n-dimensional predictor space of a particular area, while selecting points is only permitted from a small accessible sub-area or from outside the area. Sampling efficiency may be evaluated based on the representation of the predictor space. However, not only each predictor’s probability function but also the interaction between predictors may have to be considered, to select a representative sample. Instead of sampling a previously un-sampled area with limited accessibility, the four sampling designs may also be used to subsample an existing dataset and, thereby, optimise a suboptimal dataset based on the predictor space of the area which shall be mapped by DSM.},

Statistical sampling theory deals with how a dataset must be constructed that allows for the transferability of the insights from the collected data to the system. Stratified and balanced sampling schemes applied for environmental survey, seek to reduce the necessary amount of data to capture the spatial heterogeneity of a landscape. The particular design’s specification depends on the field of application. Against this background, the author strives to draw the attention to the conceptual shortcomings of conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) in the context of soil survey and digital soil mapping. Furthermore, a new sampling design is presented which (1) combines the advantages of both, stratified and balanced designs, (2) shows consistency in the application of pedogenetic theory, and (3) which can be obtained by some simple modifications to the computer code of cLHS. Overall, this manuscript shall promote a vivid discussion in the Pedometrics community concerning the consideration of scientific domain knowledge in statistical sampling theory.},

  abstract = {Quantification of soil spatial variability across multiple scales is important in ecological modeling, environmental prediction, precision agriculture, and natural resources management. This study investigates the variability of soil map units and soil properties at multiple scales using two case studies, and demonstrates that soil spatial variability is a function of map scale, spatial location, and specific soil property. In the first case study, the variability of soil components within a map unit, termed map unit purity, was examined at three orders of soil surveys in the Backswamp Watershed in South Carolina. Soil maps of Order I (1:7920), Order II (1:24,000) and Order IV (1:250,000) were independently obtained and examined in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The results showed that the area-weighted mean purity Pm for the Order II soil map when compared to the Order I delineations was 51–99\% for soil taxonomic units (soil series to order) and 65–85\% for soil properties important for land management in the area (texture, structure, surface thickness, hydrologic group, and drainage class). Corresponding values of Pm for the Order IV map were 24–81\% and 60–90\% when compared to the Order II delineations. In the second case study, 324 soil samples were collected across the Minnesota River Basin using a nested hierarchical sampling design that allowed for variability assessment at multiple scales through a hierarchical analysis of variance. A-horizon thickness, depth to calcium carbonate, and surface soil pH values were summarized by soil regions, hillslope positions, clusters, and point scales. The majority of the variability (over 50\% in most cases) for all three soil properties was at the local point scale, suggesting that careful examination of short-range soil property variability should not be overlooked. Possible causes of variability ranged from climate at the basin scale to localized effects of differential infiltration and runoff caused by the differences in landscape positions and soil characteristics. We recommend a hierarchical sampling approach similar to the one used in this study to inventory soil spatial variability at multiple scales so that an understanding could be developed not only for soil property variability across the landscape, but also for determining at what scale the variability is most likely to occur.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an open-source geographical information system (GIS) called Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools (Whitebox GAT). Whitebox GAT was designed to provide a platform for the rapid development and testing of experimental geospatial analysis methods, supported by its extensible design, integrated facilities for custom plug-in tool authoring, and its novel open-access design philosophy. One of the unique characteristics of Whitebox GAT is the ease with which users can inspect and modify the algorithms for individual geoprocessing tools. The open-access software model that Whitebox GAT adopts is designed to lessen the barriers that are often imposed on end-users when attempting to gain deeper understanding of how a specific function operates. While Whitebox GAT has an extensive range of GIS and remote sensing analytical capabilities, making it broadly suited for advanced scientific research applications in the Earth Sciences, this paper focusses on the software's application in the field of geomorphometry. An airborne LiDAR data set for a small headwater catchment of the Missisquoi River in northern Vermont, USA, was filtered to identify ground-points and then interpolated into a 2.0 m resolution bare-Earth DEM. The DEM was processed to remove spurious off-ground objects (mainly buildings), to reduce surface roughness under heavy forest cover, and to hydrologically pre-condition the DEM. These data were then used to extract salient hydrological structures, i.e. the stream network and their associated sub-basins.},

  abstract = {Surface roughness is a terrain parameter that has been widely applied to the study of geomorphological processes. One of the main challenges in studying roughness is its highly scale-dependent nature. Determining appropriate mapping scales in topographically heterogenous landscapes can be difficult. A method is presented for estimating multiscale surface roughness based on the standard deviation of surface normals. This method utilizes scale partitioning and integral image processing to isolate scales of surface complexity. The computational efficiency of the method enables high scale sampling density and identification of maximum roughness for each grid cell in a digital elevation model (DEM). The approach was applied to a 0.5 m resolution LiDAR DEM of a 210 km2 area near Brantford, Canada. The case study demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in roughness properties. At shorter scales, tillage patterns and other micro-topography associated with ground beneath forest cover dominated roughness scale signatures. Extensive agricultural land-use resulted in 35.6\% of the site exhibiting maximum roughness at micro-topographic scales. At larger spatial scales, rolling morainal topography and fluvial landforms, including incised channels and meander cut banks, were associated with maximum surface roughness. This method allowed for roughness mapping at spatial scales that are locally adapted to the topographic context of each individual grid cell within a DEM. Furthermore, the analysis revealed significant differences in roughness characteristics among soil texture categories, demonstrating the practical utility of locally adaptive, scale-optimized roughness.},

  abstract = {Conventional soil maps generally contain one or more soil types within a single soil polygon. But their geographic locations within the polygon are not specified. This restricts current applications of the maps in site-specific agricultural management and environmental modelling. We examined the utility of legacy pedon data for disaggregating soil polygons and the effectiveness of similarity-based prediction for making use of the under- or over-sampled legacy pedon data for the disaggregation. The method consisted of three steps. First, environmental similarities between the pedon sites and each location were computed based on soil formative environmental factors. Second, according to soil types of the pedon sites, the similarities were aggregated to derive similarity distribution for each soil type. Third, a hardening process was performed on the maps to allocate candidate soil types within the polygons. The study was conducted at the soil subgroup level in a semi-arid area situated in Manitoba, Canada. Based on 186 independent pedon sites, the evaluation of the disaggregated map of soil subgroups showed an overall accuracy of 67\% and a Kappa statistic of 0.62. The map represented a better spatial pattern of soil subgroups in both detail and accuracy compared to a dominant soil subgroup map, which was commonly used in practice. Incorrect predictions mainly occurred in the agricultural plain area and the soil subgroups that are very similar in taxonomy, indicating that new environmental covariates need to be developed. We concluded that the combination of legacy pedon data with similarity-based prediction is an effective solution for soil polygon disaggregation.},

  abstract = {Selection of training samples is a vital step in updating conventional soil maps when utilizing data mining models. Quality of training samples significantly affects the mapping results and accuracies of the updated soil maps. The area-weighted proportion method was a common method for generating training samples. However, this method usually assigns too small weight to those soil types of small areas and large weight to those of large areas in sample size allocation, which causes the unreasonable proportions of sample numbers for soil types and thereby biases the representation of soil-environmental relationships for those soil types. Meanwhile, random selection of training samples from a soil type may generate some ‘noise’ samples located in the transition areas between soil types. These two aspects in training sample selection could probably reduce the accuracy of the updated soil maps. In this study, a new method was developed to select training samples based on soil type grading according to their area coverages. The method consists of two steps. The first step is to determine the numbers of training samples for each soil type based on soil type grading so as to maintain the reasonable proportion in sample numbers among soil types with different area coverages. The second step is to select typical (representative) samples for each soil type from conventional soil map, to avoid generation of ‘noise samples’. To evaluate the proposed method, the method was compared with three other training sample selection methods with four training sample sizes. Each method was ran for 100 times to generate training sample datasets with each sample size to evaluate their effectiveness and stability. Random forest was employed to generate updated soil maps in a small watershed in Raffelson, Wisconsin (USA). The validation results showed that the graded proportion method effectively solved the imbalanced issue of training samples among soil types with area coverages in big differences caused by the area-weighted proportion strategy. Thus training samples generated using the proposed method usually obtained more accurate and reasonable mapping results than those using the area-weighted proportion strategy. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method was more stable than that of the area-weighted proportion strategy with the training sample size increasing. It is concluded that the proposed method is an effective training sample selection method for data mining model to update conventional soil maps.},

  abstract = {The lack of detailed three-dimensional soil texture information largely restricts many applications in agriculture, hydrology, climate, ecology and environment. This study predicted 90 m resolution spatial variations of sand, silt and clay contents at a national extent across China and at multiple depths 0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60, 60–100 and 100–200 cm. We used 4579 soil profiles collected from a national soil series inventory conducted recently and currently available environmental covariates. The covariates characterized environmental factors including climate, parent materials, terrain, vegetation and soil conditions. We constructed random forest models and employed a parallel computing strategy for the predictions of soil texture fractions based on its relationship with the environmental factors. Quantile regression forest was used to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions. Results showed that the predicted maps were much more accurate and detailed than the conventional linkage maps and the SoilGrids250m product, and could well represent spatial variation of soil texture across China. The relative accuracy improvement was around 245–370\% relative to the linkage maps and 83–112\% relative to the SoilGrids250m product with regard to the R2, and it was around 24–26\% and 14–19\% respectively with regard to the RMSE. The wide range between 5\% lower and 95\% upper prediction limits may suggest that there was a substantial room to improve current predictions. Besides, we found that climate and terrain factors are major controllers for spatial patterns of soil texture in China. The heat and water-driven physical and chemical weathering and wind-driven erosion processes primarily shape the pattern of clay content. The terrain, wind and water-driven deposition, erosion and transportation sorting processes of soil particles primarily shape the pattern of silt. The findings provide clues for modeling future soil evolution and for national soil security management under the background of global and regional environmental changes.},

Samples of NDVI values over 45 fields representing 8 soil associations throughout the State of Indiana were collected to assess the effect of soil conditions and acquisition date on the spectral response of the vegetation, as shown by the NDVl's. Statistical analysis of results indicate that land-cover types (forest, forest/pasture, and crops), soil texture, and soil water-holding capacity have an important effect on vegetation biomass changes as measured by AVHRR data. Acquisition dates should be selected with consideration of the phenological stages of vegetation.

We hypothesize that the dominant controlling factors (and the interactions between them) vary from region to region due to differences in each region’s local characteristics and geologic history. We test this hypothesis by applying a geographical detector method to eight physiographic divisions of the conterminous United States and identify the dominant factor(s) in each. The geographical detector method computes the power of determinant (q) that quantitatively measures the affinity between the factor considered and D. Results show that the factor (or factor combination) with the largest q value is different for physiographic regions with different characteristics and geologic histories. For example, lithology dominates in mountainous regions, curvature dominates in plains, and glaciation dominates in previously glaciated areas. The geographical detector method offers an objective framework for revealing factors controlling Earth surface processes.},

  abstract = {Object-based image classification for land-cover mapping purposes using remote-sensing imagery has attracted significant attention in recent years. Numerous studies conducted over the past decade have investigated a broad array of sensors, feature selection, classifiers, and other factors of interest. However, these research results have not yet been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the effect of different supervised object-based land-cover classification processes. In this study, we first construct a database with 28 fields using qualitative and quantitative information extracted from 254 experimental cases described in 173 scientific papers. Second, the results of the meta-analysis are reported, including general characteristics of the studies (e.g., the geographic range of relevant institutes, preferred journals) and the relationships between factors of interest (e.g., spatial resolution and study area or optimal segmentation scale, accuracy and number of targeted classes), especially with respect to the classification accuracy of different sensors, segmentation scale, training set size, supervised classifiers, and landcover types. Third, useful data on supervised object-based image classification are determined from the meta-analysis. For example, we find that supervised object-based classification is currently experiencing rapid advances, while development of the fuzzy technique is limited in the object-based framework. Furthermore, spatial resolution correlates with the optimal segmentation scale and study area, and Random Forest (RF) shows the best performance in object-based classification. The area-based accuracy assessment method can obtain stable classification performance, and indicates a strong correlation between accuracy and training set size, while the accuracy of the point-based method is likely to be unstable due to mixed objects. In addition, the overall accuracy benefits from higher spatial resolution images (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle) or agricultural sites where it also correlates with the number of targeted classes. More than 95.6\% of studies involve an area less than 300 ha, and the spatial resolution of images is predominantly between 0 and 2 m. Furthermore, we identify some methods that may advance supervised object-based image classification. For example, deep learning and type-2 fuzzy techniques may further improve classification accuracy. Lastly, scientists are strongly encouraged to report results of uncertainty studies to further explore the effects of varied factors on supervised objectbased image classification.},

  abstract = {Pedology focuses on understanding soil genesis in the field and includes soil classification and mapping. Digital soil mapping (DSM) has evolved from traditional soil classification and mapping to the creation and population of spatial soil information systems by using field and laboratory observations coupled with environmental covariates. Pedological knowledge of soil distribution and processes can be useful for digital soil mapping. Conversely, digital soil mapping can bring new insights to pedogenesis, detailed information on vertical and lateral soil variation, and can generate research questions that were not considered in traditional pedology. This review highlights the relevance and synergy of pedology in soil spatial prediction through the expansion of pedological knowledge. We also discuss how DSM can support further advances in pedology through improved representation of spatial soil information. Some major findings of this review are as follows: (a) soil classes can be mapped accurately using DSM, (b) the occurrence and thickness of soil horizons, whole soil profiles and soil parent material can be predicted successfully with DSM techniques, (c) DSM can provide valuable information on pedogenic processes (e.g. addition, removal, transformation and translocation), (d) pedological knowledge can be incorporated into DSM, but DSM can also lead to the discovery of knowledge, and (e) there is the potential to use process-based soil–landscape evolution modelling in DSM. Based on these findings, the combination of data-driven and knowledge-based methods promotes even greater interactions between pedology and DSM.},

  abstract = {Soil surveys often contain multi-component map units comprising two or more soil classes, whose spatial distribution within the map unit is not represented. Digital Soil Mapping tools supported by information from soil surveys make it possible to predict where these classes are located. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to increase the detail of conventional soil maps by means of spatial disaggregation of multi-component map units and to predict the spatial location of the derived soil classes. Three digital maps of terrain variables - slope, landforms, and topographic wetness index were correlated with the soil map and 72 georeferenced profiles from the Porto Alegre soil survey. Explicit rules that expressed regional soil-landscape relationships were formulated based on the resulting combinations. These rules were used to select typical areas of occurrence of each soil class and to train a decision tree model to predict the occurrence of individualized soil classes. Validation of the soil map predictions was conducted by comparison with available soil profiles. The soil map produced showed high agreement (80.5 \% accuracy) with the soil classes observed in the soil profiles; Ultisols and Lithic Udorthents were predicted with greater accuracy. The soil variables selected in this study were suitable to represent the soil-landscape relationships, suggesting potential use in future studies. This approach developed a more detailed soil map relevant to current demands for soil information and has potential to be replicated in other areas in which data availability is similar.},

  abstract = {Different uses of soil legacy data such as training dataset as well as the selection of soil environmental covariables could drive the accuracy of machine learning techniques. Thus, this study evaluated the ability of the Random Forest algorithm to predict soil classes from different training datasets and extrapolate such information to a similar area. The following training datasets were extracted from legacy data: a) point data composed of 53 soil samples; b) 30 m buffer around the soil samples, and soil map polygons excluding: c) 20 m; and d) 30 m from the boundaries of polygons. These four datasets were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce multidimensionality. Each dataset derived a new one. Different combinations of predictor variables were tested. A total of 52 models were evaluated by means of error of models, prediction uncertainty and external validation for overall accuracy and Kappa index. The best result was obtained by reducing the number of predictors with the PCA along with information from the buffer around the points. Although Random Forest has been considered a robust spatial predictor model, it was clear it is sensitive to different strategies of selecting training dataset. Effort was necessary to find the best training dataset for achieving a suitable level of accuracy of spatial prediction. To identify a specific dataset seems to be better than using a great number of variables or a large volume of training data. The efforts made allowed for the accurate acquisition of a mapped area 15.5 times larger than the reference area.},

  abstract = {A robust new approach for describing and segmenting landforms which is directly applicable to precision farming has been developed in Alberta. The model uses derivatives computed from DEMs and a fuzzy rule base to identify up to 15 morphologically deÿned landform facets. The procedure adds several measures of relative landform position to the previous classiÿcation of Pennock et al. (Geoderma 40 (1987) 297–315; 64 (1994) 1–19). The original 15 facets can be grouped to re ect di erences in complexity of the area or scale of application. Research testing suggests that a consolidation from 15 to 3 or 4 units provides practical, relevant separations at a farm ÿeld scale. These units are related to movement and accumulation of water in the landscape and are signiÿcantly di erent in terms of soil characteristics and crop yields. The units provide a base for benchmark soil testing, for applying biological models and for developing agronomic prescriptions and management options.

The applications illustrate efforts to produce meaningful classifications of ecological and landform spatial entities and to automatically extract hydrological spatial entities required for input into the WEPP water erosion model. Fine spatial resolution DEMs present some unique problems for which solutions are still lacking or are insufficient. Errors of apparently minor extent or degree can seriously affect some forms of analysis, especially analyses that involve hydrological calculations of paths of surface water flow. A need is recognized for improved methods and tools for interpolating and editing fine spatial resolution DEMs to remove or reduce localized errors.},

Soil survey is a paradigm-based science that relies heavily on the application of conceptual soil-landscape models, which in turn are based upon tacit pedological knowledge. This tacit knowledge is generally acquired by systematic field observation and recording the relationships between the occurrence of soils and associated landform positions. Soil survey databases identify the types of soils within a delineated area but they do not generally describe the relationship of specific soils with specific landscape positions. A case in point is the recently completed 1:100 000 scale soil landscape database prepared for the agricultural region of Alberta, Canada. In order to utilize this database with various interpretative algorithms a procedure for allocating soils to specific landform positions needed to be developed. The development of this procedure initially involved capturing the local tacit pedological knowledge in a series of tables and programs. The procedure was then applied to the Alberta soil survey database to automatically assign soils to landform positions and then to assign specific slope characteristics to the individual soils. The resulting soil-landform product was more useable than the original data for input to land based process models.},

  abstract = {Procedures for automated predictive thematic mapping were developed and applied to project areas totaling more than 3 million ha of forested land in British Columbia, Canada. The effective scale of mapping was 1:20,000 using data at a grid resolution of 25 m. The methods can be described as a form of automated feature extraction or object recognition where the objects of interest consist of ecological site types. The methods implement a hybrid of automated, semi-automated and manual procedures that develop and apply heuristic, rule-based conceptual models of ecological-landform relationships. The methods rely heavily upon terrain derivatives extracted from available digital elevation models (DEMs) in addition to satellite imagery and manually digitized maps of ancillary environmental conditions. The primary input has been the BC provincial Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) digital elevation model (DEM) surfaced to a regular grid of 25 m. Other input layers include manually interpreted maps of parent material texture, depth and ecological exception classes, manually prepared maps of the spatial distribution of ecological zones of the BC Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) system and, to a limited extent, LandSat7 digital satellite imagery. The procedures do not use any field sampling to develop or train classification rules. A knowledge-based approach is used to establish classification rules which are defined and implemented using a Semantic Import (SI) Model implementation of fuzzy logic. All rules are constructed by examining and deconstructing published field guides that define the required ecological output classes and that document the current expert understanding of the conditions and criteria that control the spatial distribution of these desired output classes. An iterative, trial and error, process is used to develop, apply, evaluate and revise object recognition rules that relate ranges of values of key input data layers to an expert-assigned likelihood of occurrence for each ecological class of interest. Local expert knowledge is used at each stage to evaluate each new set of output results and to guide refinement of the fuzzy SI model classification rules. Field sample observations obtained along randomly selected closed traverses were collected following a line intercept approach and used to assess the accuracy of the final predictions of ecological classification. Application of the procedures has progressed from an initial pilot project through projects to evaluate operational scale-up to full-scale commercial application to millions of hectares. Costs have been reduced from a high of \$3.50/ha to less than \$0.20/ha. Rates of progress increased from 150,000 ha per person year to more than 2.0 million ha per person year. Independent assessments of map accuracy produced results superior to the highest accuracies reported for all alternatives, including traditional manual mapping methods. We conclude that we have formalized and automated many of the concepts and techniques previously used to create thematic maps of ecosystems using manual interpretation of stereo air photos and ancillary data combined with field observations. We have shown that automated feature extraction is able to capture and apply the concepts of landform control referenced by typical landform-based ecological models and classification systems. We have demonstrated that it is possible to produce accurate and cost-effective ecological-landform maps by applying fuzzy and Boolean logic and automated landform analysis procedures to widely available spatial data.},

An extensive surficial and sedimentary cover, limits our understanding of the Craton’s geology and prospectivity is in comparison with other Australian Cratons. A lack of exposure of fresh outcrop results from the combination of deep weathering, which produces a thick in-situ regolith and the presence of significant transported alluvial and colluvial sheetflow deposits, ferruginous consolidated aeolian sands, evaporites and alluvial channel deposits. The area also has an extensive cover of laterite, calcrete and silcrete with minor weathered saprolite and very limited fresh rock outcrop. This geologic and regolith setting results in a subdued geomorphic province dominated by major low relief perennial drainage and palaeodrainage systems and dune landforms.},

  abstract = {There is a need for accurate, quantitative soil information for natural resource planning and management. This information shapes the way decisions are made as to how soil resources are assessed and managed. This paper proposes a novel method for whole-soil profile predictions (to 1 m) across user-defined study areas where limited soil information exists. Using the Edgeroi district in north-western NSW as the test site, we combined equal-area spline depth functions with digital soil mapping techniques to predict the vertical and lateral variations of carbon storage and available water capacity (AWC) across the 1500 km2 area. Neural network models were constructed for both soil attributes to model their relationship with a suite of environmental factors derived from a digital elevation model, radiometric data and Landsat imagery. Subsequent fits of the models resulted in an R2 of 44\% for both carbon and AWC. For validation at selected model depths, R2 values ranged between 20 and 27\% for carbon prediction (RMSE: 0.30–0.52 log (kg/m3)) and between 8 and 29\% for AWC prediction (RMSE: 0.01 m/m). Visually, reconstruction of splines at selected validation data points indicated an average fit with raw data values. In order to improve upon our model and validation results there is a need to address some of the structural and metrical uncertainties identified in this study. Nevertheless, the resulting geo-database of quantitative soil information describing its spatial and vertical variations is an example of what can be generated with this proposed methodology. We also demonstrate the functionality of this geo-database in terms of data enquiry for user-defined queries.},

This method obviates the need to identify and determine the contribution of each source of uncertainty to the overall prediction uncertainty. Conceptually, in the context of digital soil mapping, rather than a single point estimate at every prediction location, a PI, characterised by upper and lower prediction limits, encloses the prediction (which lies somewhere on the interval) and ideally the true but unknown value 100(1 − α)\% of times on average the target variable (typically 95\%). The idea is to partition the environmental covariate feature space into clusters which share similar attributes using fuzzy kmeans with extragrades. Model error for predicting a target variable is then estimated from which cluster PIs are constructed on the basis of the empirical distribution of errors associated with the observations belonging to each cluster. PIs for each non-calibration observation are then formulated on the basis of the grade of membership each has to each cluster.},

  abstract = {A programme scripted for use in an R programming environment called dissever is presented. This programme was designed to facilitate a generalised method for downscaling coarsely resolved earth resource information using available finely gridded covariate data. Under the assumption that the relationship between the target variable being downscaled and the available covariates can be nonlinear, dissever uses weighted generalised additive models (GAMs) to drive the empirical function. An iterative algorithm of GAM fitting and adjustment attempts to optimise the downscaling to ensure that the target variable value given for each coarse grid cell equals the average of all target variable values at the fine scale in each coarse grid cell. A number of outputs needed for mapping results and diagnostic purposes are automatically generated from dissever. We demonstrate the programs’ functionality by downscaling a soil organic carbon (SOC) map with 1-km by 1-km grid resolution down to a 90-m by 90-m grid resolution using available covariate information derived from a digital elevation model, Landsat ETM þ data, and airborne gamma radiometric data. dissever produced high quality results as indicated by a low weighted root mean square error between averaged 90-m SOC predictions within their corresponding 1-km grid cell (0.82 kg mÀ3). Additionally, from a concordance between the downscaled map and another map created using digital soil mapping methods there was a strong agreement (0.94). Future versioning of dissever will investigate quantifying the uncertainty of the downscaled outputs.},

  abstract = {Terroir in the Lower Hunter Valley – a prominent wine-producing region of Australia – is an appealing concept for landowners both in terms of enabling strategic land management and for positioning businesses favourably in a competitive consumer market. To those ends, preliminary steps are made in this study to establish common soil and landscape entities in the area using the terron concept that was proposed by Carré and McBratney (2005). Here soil and landscape variables were assembled and then used to generate 12 terrons or continuous soillandscape units which are described quantitatively in terms of their distinguishing characteristics. Each terron is characterised by landscape variables (derived from a digital elevation model) and soil variables which include soil pH, clay percentage, soil mineralogy (clay types and presence of iron oxides), continuous soil classes, and presence or absence of marl. This study demonstrates a number of soil inferential techniques used for assembling the soil terron variables, based on common or easy to measure soil properties that populate most soil information databases. The approach is the first step in describing terroir; the next step will be to match the terrons with different grape varietals.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of model averaging (ensemble modelling) as an approach for combining digital soil property maps derived from disaggregated legacy soil class maps and scorpan kriging (using soil point data). The study is based in the Dalrymple Shire, QLD and continues on the soil pH mapping work of Odgers et al. (2014a). Equal weights averaging (EW), Bates–Granger or variance weighted averaging (VW), Granger–Ramanathan averaging (GRA), and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) were compared in this study. Model averaged predictions were estimated to 2 m depth at regular depth intervals. 90\% prediction intervals of the model averaged predictions were derived numerically. Neither the disaggregated soil map nor the scorpan kriging map was particularly accurate. Predictions from model averaging however did improve upon the accuracy, where at all depths, the combined predictions were an improvement on using either of the contributing soil maps alone. We recommend the use of GRA for digital soil mapping applications because its performance is equal to or better than the generally preferred BMA approach, yet far simpler to implement, and is computationally efficient. For regional soil studies where polygon mapping and soil point data are available, ensemble modelling is a useful combinatorial approach.},

The intention here is to predict at fine spatial resolution, total gamma radiometric counts across a large mapping extent (recipient site) on the basis of finely resolved information collected from a nearby donor site. The extrapolation methods used were a digital soil mapping (DSM) regression model approach and a multivariate multiple-point statistical (MPS) approach. Qualitative interpretation of the results from both extrapolation approaches across the recipient site in the Lower Hunter Valley, Australia (area ≈ 220 km2) shows promise in terms of highlighting known geochemical and physical variations of soils in this area. The extrapolated map was evaluated in a small portion of the study area (area ≈ 4 km2) where similar high-resolution gamma radiometric data were available. Results show comparable performance of both approaches where a root-mean-square error of 87 ppm was found. A concordance correlation coefficient value of 0.04 was found for the DSM approach, but higher for the MPS approach (0.16). Under the Homosoil framework, where soil point data and mapping are sparse, either method investigated in this study would be suitable as a ‘first-cut’ approach for developing a comprehensive soil information system in those areas.},

"There are two principal approaches for making predictions of soil at unobserved locations. The first approach subdivides the soil coverage into discrete spatial units within which the soils conform to the characteristics of a class in some soil classification (Heuvelink and Webster 2001)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=1}{Malone et al 2018:373})
\par
"The second approach is necessarily quantitative, as it requires numerical methods for interpolation between the locations of actual soil observations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=2}{Malone et al 2018:374})
\par
"The maps that result from this process are commonly known as choropleth or area-class maps because each delineation, or polygon, in the map belongs to one and only one category (Wright 1944)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=2}{Malone et al 2018:374})
\par
"Burrough et al. (1997) labelled this kind of mapping double crisp because the identified soil groups are supposed to be crisply delineated in both taxonomic space (the space defined by the soil properties) and geographic space." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=2}{Malone et al 2018:374})
\par
"A criticism levelled at this heuristic approach to soil mapping is that the learned concepts are generally unfalsifiable and therefore unverifiable in any objective sense (Hewitt 1993; Lagacherie et al. 1995)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=2}{Malone et al 2018:374})
\par
"The cartographic scale often limits the application of legacy mapping to resolve particular questions (Hartemink et al. 2008). The cost and time required to compile a soil map using traditional methods is expensive, so it is usually prohibitive" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=2}{Malone et al 2018:374})

"Mapping the spatial variability of soil properties requires the use of geospatial prediction models as well as incorporating gridded or raster-based data models to make predictions onto and display maps (thus a trend away from the polygon data model)."

"but such models were not put into a framework for spatial prediction until the early 1990s once computing power and raster technology were sufficiently developed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=5}{Malone et al 2018:377})

\par
"Efforts by other researchers soon followed. McKenzie and Austin (1993) realised that multivariate soil-landscape models could lead to a new type of soil survey and coined the term environmental correlation to describe the process" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=5}{Malone et al 2018:377})

"This approach is necessarily quantitative and relies on the assumption that the soil observations are correlated with the environmental data to some degree." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=5}{Malone et al 2018:377})
\par
"During the mid-1990s researchers realised that the classical geostatistical approach to soil spatial prediction could be merged with the environmental correlation approach. The combined approach became known as regression-kriging (Odeh et al. 1995). Regression-kriging can be summarised in three steps:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=5}{Malone et al 2018:377})

"If there is evidence of a spatial trend in the residuals, sum the residuals and the environmental correlation prediction to arrive at a final prediction of the target soil attribute at the unvisited sites." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=6}{Malone et al 2018:378})
\par
"Regression-kriging, when the regression component is a multiple linear regression model, is equivalent to universal kriging (Stein and Corsten 1991), or kriging with external drift (Wackernagel 1998) or even kriging after de-trending (Goovaerts 1999)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=6}{Malone et al 2018:378})
\par
"n such cases the soil attribute is some linear function of the predictors. Regression-kriging differs from universal kriging when more complex models like regression trees are used in practice." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=6}{Malone et al 2018:378})

"Scull et al. (2003) wrote about past research in soil spatial prediction from a physical geographic perspective and coined the term predictive soil mapping to describe the general approach. About the same time, McBratney et al. (2003) generalised the diversity of quantitative mapping approaches into a framework they called scorpan, which uses a clorpt-like framework not for mere explanation but rather empirical quantitative description of soil-landscape relationships for the purpose of spatial prediction. They called these activities digital soil mapping (DSM)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRKBEPAM?page=6}{Malone et al 2018:378})

Digital elevation models (DEMs; Minasny et al. 2008) and remotely and proximally sensed data are two prominent examples (Mulder et al. 2011)."

"This is followed by fitting some kind of mathematical or statistical function to a set of pedologically meaningful environmental layers which are generally gridded raster layers of a given spatial resolution. Once the model is fitted at the m observation points, the model is extended to all grid cell nodes of the raster layers, giving a digital soil map."

"Generally, some models, such as multiple linear regression or regression trees, are suited to modelling continuous variables, whereas others, such as logistic regression or classification trees, are suited to modelling ordinal or nominal categorical data. Some of the simplest models are simple linear models with either ordinary or generalised least-squares fitting. More complex models include generalised linear and additive models (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990). Logistic regression models are a type of generalised linear model suited to modelling categorical variables (Kempen et al. 2009)."

  abstract = {Space Technology provides a resourceful-cost effective means to assess soil nutrients essential for soil management plan. Soil organic matter (SOM) is one of valuable controlling productivity of crops by providing nutrient in farming systems. Geospatial modeling of soil organic matter is essential if there is unavailability of soil test laboratories and its strong spatial correlation. In the present analysis, soil organic matter is modeled from satellite image derived spectral color indices. Brightness Index (BI), Coloration Index (CI), Hue Index (HI), Redness Index (RI) and Saturation Index (SI) were calculated by converting DN value to radiance and radiance to reflectance from Thematic Mapper image. Geospatial model was developed by regressing SOM with color indices and producing multiple regression model using stepwise regression technique. The multiple regression equation between SOM and spectral indices was significant with R = 0. 56 at 95\% confidence level. The resulting MLR equation was then used for the spatial prediction for the entire study area. Redness Index was found higher significance in estimating the SOM. It was used to predict SOM as auxiliary variables using cokringing spatial interpolation technique. It was tested in seven VDCs of Chitwan district of Nepal using Thematic Mapper remotely sensed data. SOM was found to be measured ranging from 0.15\% to 4.75 \%, with a mean of 2.24 \%. Remotely sensed data derived spectral color indices have the potential as useful auxiliary variables for estimating SOM content to generate soil fertility management plans.},

  abstract = {Hillslope elements have considerable potential in predicting soil properties and types in the landscape, making them likely to be a useful basis for detailed soil mapping. The goal of this research was to apply a previously developed digital hillslope position (DHP) model, calibrate it as needed to a Brazilian landscape, and test its utility as a basis for identification of detailed soil map units. The study area covers 2500 ha and is located on the border between the municipalities of Piracicaba and Santa Bárbara d'Oeste, São Paulo state, Brazil. A digital elevation model, with spatial resolution of 5 m, was used to obtain slope gradient, profile curvature and relative elevation with different analysis scales. Hierarchical rules for these digital terrain derivatives were used to segment the landscape into hillslope positions. The user-calibrated hillslope position model was verified against local experience by identifying the hillslope position in the field and comparing it with the model classification using the Kappa statistic and a confusion matrix. Soil samples were collected across multiple hillslopes with different lithologies. The samples were analyzed for chemical composition and soil particle size separates. The measured soil properties were assessed for statistical significance by variance analysis among hillslope position, parent material, and the interaction between the two. Student's t-tests were performed iteratively across each hillslope position within a given parent material to identify specifically which soil properties were significantly different among the hillslope position map units. Variance analysis of soil samples located within the respective parent material map units identified significant differences for all soil properties measured, but only for some soil properties when categorized by DHP. Focusing on the parent material with a sufficient quantity of samples, there was always at least one hillslope position that was significantly different from the others for each soil property. Because each of these map units presented a significant difference in at least one soil property, they are useful for detailed soil mapping.},

  abstract = {Land component boundaries often coincide with transitions in environmental land properties such as soil, climate and biology. Image segmentation is an effective method for delineating terrain morphological units from digital elevation models (DEMs). This paper compares the land components derived from five DEMs. The second version of the 30-m advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global DEM (ASTER GDEM2), the 90-m shuttle radar topography mission DEM (SRTM DEM), two versions of the 5-m Stellenbosch University DEMs (SUDEM L1 and L2) and a 5-m DEM (GEOEYE DEM) derived from GeoEye stereo-images were considered. The SRTM DEM and the ASTER GDEM2 were upsampled to 5-m resolution for comparison purposes. Land components were delineated using the slope gradient and aspect derivatives of each DEM. The resulting land components were visually inspected and quantitatively analyzed using the slope gradient standard deviation (SGSD) measure and the mean slope gradient local variance (MSGLV) ratio. The results show that the GEOEYE DEM and SUDEM L2 yielded land components with relatively low SGSD values and that their boundaries often coincide with morphological discontinuities. The GEOEYE DEM produced land components with the highest MSGLV ratio, followed by SUDEM L2, ASTER GDEM2, SRTM DEM and SUDEM L1. Although the land components derived from SRTM DEM and SUDEM L1 were relatively homogeneous internally, their boundaries did not always trace morphological discontinuities. The ASTER GDEM2 failed to incorporate many of the morphological discontinuities in the study area. It is concluded that, although the SRTM DEM is more suitable than the ASTER GDEM2 for generating land components, higherresolution DEMs such as the GEOEYE DEM and SUDEM L2 are required for delineating meaningful land components. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Inadequacy of spatial soil information is one of the limiting factors to making evidence-based decisions to improve food security and land management in the developing countries. Various digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques have been applied in many parts of the world to improve availability and usability of soil data, but less has been done in Africa, particularly in Tanzania and at the scale necessary to make farm management decisions. The Kilombero Valley has been identified for intensified rice production. However the valley lacks detailed and up-todate soil information for decision-making. The overall objective of this study was to develop a predictive soil map of a portion of Kilombero Valley using DSM techniques. Two widely used decision tree algorithms and three sources of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were evaluated for their predictive ability. Firstly, a numerical classification was performed on the collected soil profile data to arrive at soil taxa. Secondly, the derived taxa were spatially predicted and mapped following SCORPAN framework using Random Forest (RF) and J48 machine learning algorithms. Datasets to train the model were derived from legacy soil map, RapidEye satellite image and three DEMs: 1 arc SRTM, 30 m ASTER, and 12 m WorldDEM. Separate predictive models were built using each DEM source. Mapping showed that RF was less sensitive to the training set sampling intensity. Results also showed that predictions of soil taxa using 1 arc SRTM and 12 m WordDEM were identical. We suggest the use of RF algorithm and the freely available SRTM DEM combination for mapping the soils for the whole Kilombero Valley. This combination can be tested and applied in other areas which have relatively flat terrain like the Kilombero Valley. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The concepts of hierarchy, grain, extent, scale and variability are discussed. Slight modifications to the Hoosbeek-Bryant scheme to deal with spatial and temporal scales and various types of quantitative models are suggested. Approaches to aggregation or upscaling are reviewed. The contributions of representative elementary volume (REV), variograms, fractal theory, multi-resolution analysis using wavelets, critical point phenomena, renormalisation groups and transfer functions are discussed followed by a brief presentation of some ecological approaches including extrapolation by lumping, extrapolation by increasing model extent and extrapolation by explicit integration. A clear distinction must be made between additive and nonadditive variables. The scaling of the former is much less problematic than the latter. Corroboration of any approach by testing against the aggregated values seems problematic. Methods of disaggregation or downscaling including transfer functions, mass-preserving or pycnophylactic methods are also discussed. In order to make quantitative advances, nested sampling or reanalysis of data in land information systems to obtain variance information over a complete range of scales is required. Finally an appeal is made for work to begin on a quantitative scale-explicit theory of soil variation.},

  abstract = {Digital soil assessment is crucial for DSM to be useful. Assessment can be driven by stakeholders, or by soil scientists themselves. Stakeholder-driven assessments are largely motivated by global issues such as food, water and energy security; climate change mitigation and provision of environmental-services. Each of these motivations requires an appropriate set of soil properties, quality assessment methods and tools. Soil-science-led assessment based on multiple soil properties has a long history, beginning with land evaluation and recently expanding to include assessment of Soil Quality and Soil Protection. Soil scientists can also provide valuable contributions to assessments driven by wider groups of stakeholders and include Environmental Life Cycle Analysis and Soil as Natural Capital. The relative utility and value of stakeholder assessments versus soil-science-led assessment requires evaluation. The potential to greatly expand the use of DSM products in the construction of assessments with a wide range of motivations and goals has considerable implications for the further development of digital soil mapping. In general, more emphasis is needed on both the current and potential future contributions of DSM to various assessments, which should be done with expedition.},

  abstract = {Soil security, an overarching concept of soil motivated by sustainable development, is concerned with the maintenance and improvement of the global soil resource to produce food, fibre and fresh water, contribute to energy and climate sustainability, and to maintain the biodiversity and the overall protection of the ecosystem. Security is used here for soil in the same sense that it is used widely for food and water. It is argued that soil has an integral part to play in the global environmental sustainability challenges of food security, water security, energy sustainability, climate stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem service delivery. Indeed, soil has the same existential status as these issues and should be recognized and highlighted similarly. The concept of soil security is multidimensional. It acknowledges the five dimensions of (1) capability, (2) condition, (3) capital, (4) connectivity and (5) codification, of soil entities which encompass the social, economic and biophysical sciences and recognize policy and legal frameworks. The soil security concept is compared with the cognate, but more limited, notions of soil quality, health and protection.},

  abstract = {Conventional and quantitative methods require synthesis for digital soil mapping to reach its full potential, particularly when survey extents are large (i.e. 410,000 km2), data are sparse and resources are limited. One of the challenges is to express narratives of pedogenesis in an explicit form that can be incorporated into digital soil mapping. We present an applied example where such a narrative is developed – it emphasizes landscape history, provenance of soil parent materials and pedogenic process. The narrative is then expressed as rules that are used to produce digital soil maps. The rules are parsimonious; they encourage testing and enable spatial prediction; and are easy to update. The rules rely on just a few terrain and geophysical variables. We demonstrate how a new terrain variable, the multiresolution valley-bottom flatness (MrVBF) index, can be used with the familiar topographic wetness index (TWI), to map geomorphic and soil features.},

Its main contribution is the evaluation of different remote sensing methodologies for mapping saline soils in areas highly affected by soil degradation. The study area is located in SE Spain (between the cities of Elche and Alicante) and is characterized by a semiarid climate and the presence of numerous saline soils and salt-flats. Imaging spectroscopy techniques such as Matched Filtering (MF) and Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) techniques were used for mapping saline soils. Two different approaches were applied for mapping saline soils: 1) using image based spectra of saline and non-saline training areas, and 2) using the spectrum of the halite mineral as a proxy to the spectra of saline soils, because halite concentrations are significant in the saline soils of the study area. MF and MTMF mapping techniques were applied in both methodological approaches. Accuracy assessment was evaluated with the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot technique. A validation procedure was applied with an independent saline and non-saline validation dataset. Training and validation saline and non-saline pixels were limited to areas with low vegetation coverage to avoid spectral interferences.},

  abstract = {Prediction of soil attributes and soil classes in digital soil mapping relies on finding relationships between soil and the predictor variables of soil-forming factors and processes. The predictor variables can be remotely or proximally sensed images of soil, landscape, parent material or climatic factors. Till date, most prediction methods are based on performing regression on the predictor variables directly to predict soil attributes or classes. There are problems using data layers from different sources, particularly, multicollinearity, and the fact that the relationships between soil and environmental variables can change with spatial scale. To overcome the problem of correlation between variables, principal component analysis can be performed on the predictor variables. With respect to the spatial dependency, each of these variables can be decomposed into separate spatial components and mapped separately. One of the methods of achieving this is wavelet analysis, which decomposes the variables into separate hierarchical spatial components of decreasing spatial resolution. These components could all be derived and subsequently used as separate layers in predicting soil classes or soil attributes. In this chapter, data are decomposed using the wavelet method and examples of predictions of soil classes and surface-clay content are shown, in order to evaluate the effect of using the decomposed layers in comparison with the original data.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we shall discuss about the state of the art of the Brazilian soil survey and mapping, including a brief history of soil surveys in Brazil, a summary description of survey methods and techniques, mapping paradigms, as well as the present-day needs and current challenges. Digital soil mapping is viewed as an opportunity to recover the unaccomplished soil mapping program in Brazil. We also focus on several attempts to make a national soil database, starting at the beginning of the 1980s with SisSolos, followed by SigSolos, and lately, SigWeb ‘‘Iniciativa Solos br’’, available at http:// www.cnps.embrapa.br/soilsbr and the country’s new challenges to improve soil mapping, as well as some insights into digital soil mapping. Traditional soil surveys in Brazil have covered almost the whole country; these soil surveys are mainly in small-scale mapping, except for the Amazon region, which is poorly provided with soil surveys. Four main governmental institutions, Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC) and Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM), execute soil surveys at the national and state levels. Private consultants also perform soil surveys, particularly on larger scales, under private contracts. Consequently, there is much dispersed information about soil surveys, but at least the methods and procedures are kept reasonably uniform all over the country. The systematic, governmental-supported soil mapping of the entire country, as initially planned, has been cancelled for a long time, although the demand for soil survey information continues at the same or even higher levels in some regions. At present, complete soil mapping covers 17 states out of 26, and the Federal District, at scales ranging from 1:100,000 to 1:600,000, covers approximately 35\% of Brazilian soil, as well as a full uniform cover at scales of 1:1,000,000 and 1:5,000,000. Extensive zones still lack complete soil information at suitable scales and survey levels, needed to face the current problems of use, management, conservation, prevention and recovery of agriculturally and nonagriculturally degraded areas. Nowadays, soil surveys are made only on governmental demands, to support agroecological zonings and evaluation of environmental-impact projects, precision agriculture, degraded-area reclamation, planning of rural settlements and land-use planning, and are always linked to multidisciplinary activities. Soil and environmental data organisation, structuring and availability is imperative to perform digital soil mapping, which will certainly generate demands of quality databases as well as of the necessary tools for institutions involved in soil surveys in Brazil.},

  abstract = {Soil salinity caused by natural or human-induced processes is a major environmental hazard. The global extent of primary salt-affected soils is about 955 M ha, while secondary salinization affects some 77 M ha, with 58\% of these in irrigated areas. Nearly 20\% of all irrigated land is salt-affected, and this proportion tends to increase in spite of considerable efforts dedicated to land reclamation. This requires careful monitoring of the soil salinity status and variation to curb degradation trends, and secure sustainable land use and management. Multitemporal optical and microwave remote sensing can significantly contribute to detecting temporal changes of salt-related surface features. Airborne geophysics and ground-based electromagnetic induction meters, combined with ground data, have shown potential for mapping depth of salinity occurrence. This paper reviews various sensors (e.g. aerial photographs, satellite- and airborne multispectral sensors, microwave sensors, video imagery, airborne geophysics, hyperspectral sensors, and electromagnetic induction meters) and approaches used for remote identification and mapping of salt-affected areas. Constraints on the use of remote sensing data for mapping saltaffected areas are shown related to the spectral behaviour of salt types, spatial distribution of salts on the terrain surface, temporal changes on salinity, interference of vegetation, and spectral confusions with other terrain surfaces.},

  abstract = {High resolution terrain models generated from widely available Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) and digital photogrammetry are an exciting resource for geomorphological research. However, these data contain error, necessitating pre-processing to improve their quality. We evaluate the ability of digital filters to improve topographic representation, using: (1) a Gaussian noise removal filter; (2) the proprietary filters commonly applied to these datasets; and (3) a terrain sensitive filter, similar to those applied to laser altimetry data. Topographic representation is assessed in terms of both absolute accuracy measured with reference to independent check data and derived geomorphological variables (slope, upslope contributing area, topographic index and landslide failure probability) from a steepland catchment in northern England. Results suggest that proprietary filters often degrade or fail to improve precision. A combination of terrain sensitive and Gaussian filters performs best for both IfSAR and digital photogrammetry datasets, improving the precision of photogrammetry digital elevation models (DEMs) by more than 50 per cent relative to the unfiltered data. High-frequency noise and high-magnitude gross errors corrupt geomorphological variables derived from unfiltered photogrammetry DEMs. However, a terrain sensitive filter effectively removes gross errors and noise is minimized using a Gaussian filter. These improvements propagate through derived variables in a landslide prediction model, to reduce the area of predicted instability by up to 29 per cent of the study area. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar is susceptible to removal of topographic detail by oversmoothing and its errors are less sensitive to filtering (maximum improvement in precision of 5 per cent relative to the raw data).

The ability to link databases with geospatial delineations and to store unique information for individual delineations creates the opportunity for this information to serve many other areas of study. This study created a Quaternary geologic map by categorizing soil descriptions into a geologic context and joining the attributes with the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database in ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA). The resulting map communicates many of the spatial intricacies of the Des Moines Lobe landform with 15 map units based on geologic units. The display of these map units shows detailed features of ground moraine, stagnation moraine, glacial lakes, outwash, and loess deposits. Qualitative visual assessment shows that our Quaternary geologic map has generally good agreement with existing Quaternary geologic maps while including finer detailed information and user-controllable scale. On the basis of these results, we envision widespread use of this method.},

  abstract = {Soil mapping is a major goal of soil science. Soil maps rely upon accurate base maps, both for positional reference and to provide environmental data that can assist in the prediction of soil properties. This paper reviews the historical development of base maps used for soil mapping, and evaluates the dependence of soil mapping on base maps. The availability of geographic technology for producing base maps has both constrained and directed the geographic study of soil. The lack of accurate methods for determining location limited early geographic descriptions of soils to narratives, or to listings of attributes for property-based map units. The first real base maps available for soil mapping were outline maps produced in the late 18th century, fueled by governments' interests in documenting national boundaries and popular interest in world atlases. These early soil maps primarily used outline maps as a positional reference onto which soil-related thematic detail was added. Eventually, additional spatial information, in the form of topographic maps and later aerial photographs, increased the predictive role of base maps in soil mapping. In the current digital, geospatial revolution, global positioning systems and geographic information systems have nearly replaced the positional reference function of base maps. Today, base maps are more likely to be used as parameters in soil-landscape models for predicting the spatial distribution of soil properties and classes. Formerly, as a reference for spatial position, paper base maps controlled the cartographic scale of soil maps. However, this relationship is no longer true in geographic information systems. Today, as parameters for digital soil maps, base maps constitute the library of predictive variables and constrain the supported resolution of the soil map.},

  abstract = {Applying a data mining tool used regularly in digital soil mapping, this research focuses on the optimal inclusion of predictors for soil–landscape modeling by utilizing as wide of a pool of variables as possible. Predictor variables for digital soil mapping are often chosen on the basis of data availability and the researcher's expert knowledge. Predictor variables commonly overlooked include alternative analysis scales for land-surface derivatives and additional remote sensing products. For this study, a pool of 412 potential predictors was assembled, which included qualitative location classes, elevation, land-surface derivatives (with a wide range of analysis scales), hydrologic indicators, as well as proximal and remote sensing (from multiple sources with a variety of resolutions). Subsets of the full pool were also examined for comparison. The performance for the models built from the different starting predictor pools was analyzed for seven target variables. Results suggest that models with limited predictor pools can substitute other predictors to compensate for the missing variables. However, a better performing model was always found by considering predictor variables at multiple scales. Compared with baseline subsets with the most commonly used predictors for digital soil mapping at a single scale, the use of multiscale predictor variables produced an improvement in model performance ranging from negligible to a 70\% increase in the adjusted R2. Although the scale effect of the modifiable area unit problem is generally well known, this study suggests digital soil mapping efforts would be enhanced by the greater consideration of predictor variables at multiple analysis scales.},

  abstract = {We review historical soil maps from a geographical perspective, in contrast to the more traditional temporal–historical perspective. Our geographical approach examines and compares soil maps based on their scale and classification system. To analyze the connection between scale in historical soil maps and their associated classification systems, we place soil maps into three categories of cartographic scale. We then examine how categories of cartographic scale correspond to the selection of environmental soil predictors used to initially create the maps, as reflected by the maps' legend. Previous analyses of soil mapping from the temporal perspective have concluded that soil classification systems have co-evolved with gains in soil knowledge. We conclude that paradigm shifts in soil mapping and classification can be better explained by not only their correlation to historical improvements in scientific understanding, but also by differences in purpose for mapping, and due to advancements in geographic technology. We observe that, throughout history, small cartographic scale maps have tended to emphasize climate–vegetation zonation. Medium cartographic scale maps have put more emphasis on parent material as a variable to explain soil distributions. And finally, soil maps at large cartographic scales have relied more on topography as a predictive factor. Importantly, a key characteristic of modern soil classification systems is their multi-scale approach, which incorporates these phenomena scales within their classification hierarchies. Although most modern soil classification systems are based on soil properties, the soil map remains a model, the purpose of which is to predict the spatial distributions of those properties. Hence, multi-scale classification systems still tend to be organized, at least in part, by this observed spatial hierarchy. Although the hierarchy observed in this study is generally known in pedology today, it also represents a new view on the evolution of soil science. Increased recognition of this hierarchy may also help to more holistically combine soil formation factors with soil geography and pattern, particularly in the context of digital soil mapping.},

Review and comparison of various approaches to segmentation of the land surface reveals common features, and permits development of a broad theoretical basis for segmentation and for characterization of segments and their boundaries. Within the context of defining landform units that maximise internal homogeneity and external differences, this paper introduces the concept of elementary forms (segments, units) defined by constant values of fundamental morphometric properties and limited by discontinuities of the properties. The basic system of form-defining properties represents altitude and its derivatives, constant values of which provide elementary forms with various types of homogeneity. Every geometric type of elementary form can be characterized by a defining function, which is a specific case of the general polynomial fitted function. Various types of boundary discontinuity and their connections and transformations into other types of morphological unit boundaries are analysed.},

  abstract = {Mapping soil classes digitally generally starts with soil profile description with observed soil classes at a taxonomic level in a particular classification system. At each soil observation location there is a set of co-located environmental variables, and the challenge is to correlate the soil class with the environmental variables. The current methodology treats soil classes as ‘labels’ and their prediction only considers the minimisation of the misclassification error. Soil classes at any taxonomic level have taxonomic relationships between each other, and in some instances the errors in prediction of certain classes are more serious than the others. No statistical procedure so far has been utilised to account for these relationships. This paper shows that in digital mapping of soil classes, we can incorporate the taxonomic distance between soil classes in a supervised classification routine. Using classification trees, we can specify an algorithm that minimises the taxonomic distance rather than misclassification error. Two examples are given in this paper for mapping soil orders in the Australian soil classification system. A site in the Edgeroi area showed the advantage of using the method that minimises the taxonomic distance. Meanwhile a site in the Hunter Valley showed minimising the misclassification error performed similarly to minimising taxonomic distance. The advantages and challenges of using soil taxonomic distance are discussed.},

  abstract = {Pedogenesis models should give us answers to: how does soil form, how does it evolve, where does it come from and how long does it take to reach this state? This paper reviews quantitative models that describe pedogenesis ab initio and the processes that directly lead to development or evolution of soil. We review factorial, energy, and mass-balance models. An early conceptual model comes from James Hutton. The factorial model of Jenny provides the first definition of soil system and quantitative approach in pedology. Much works in pedology were devoted to proposing variations of the factorial model in a qualitative way, such as the pathways, and energy models. The energy model of Volubuyev attempts to calculate the energy of soil formation at a macro-scale and the entropy of soil at the profile scale. The energy model is used mainly as description of the state of a soil. From conceptual, empirical models, a move towards mechanistic models of soil formation followed at a slower pace. The landscape model from geomorphology has made lots of progress in quantifying and modelling soil weathering and distribution in the landscape. These models usually consider physical weathering and treat the soil as a single layer of regolith. Meanwhile mechanistic pedology models consider weathering in a profile scale at a nearly level landscape. Approach to combine these two approaches has recently been proposed. We demonstrate that a rudimentary mass-balance model can simulate soil thickness and organic carbon content variation in the landscape. A soil profile can be created by applying fundamental physical and chemical processes. The mass-balance model provides a valuable platform to model soil and link pedology to other modern earth science disciplines. We discuss some criteria for pedogenesis models and possible integration of the factorial, energy, and mass-balance models.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses methods for soil sampling that allow calibration of proximal sensor readings to soil properties. Conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) was recently proposed as a method for sampling based on covariates obtained from proximal soil sensors. The method provides full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. A modification of cLHS was made so that it samples more on the edge of the distribution. This modification, called DLHS, is inspired by the D-optimality criterion in linear regression, where the design will place sample points on the corner of the distribution. We run a simulation to test the performance of cLHS. The simulation assumed a known form of the response function of EM38, EM31, and elevation to clay content. Results showed that when the form of the model is known, it is beneficial to place more sample points on the corners of the hypercube. When the form is unknown, conventional cLHS performs better.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) is a successful sub discipline of soil science with an active research output. The success of digital soil mapping is a confluence of several factors in the beginning of 2000 including the increased availability of spatial data (digital elevation model, satellite imagery), the availability of computing power for processing data, the development of data-mining tools and GIS, and numerous applications beyond geostatistics. In addition, there was an increased global demand for spatial data including uncertainty assessments, and a rejuvenation of many soil survey and university centres which helped in the spreading of digital soil mapping technologies and knowledge. The theoretical framework for digital soil mapping was formalised in a 2003 paper in Geoderma. In this paper, we define what constitutes digital soil mapping, sketch a brief history of it, and discuss some lessons. Digital soil mapping requires three components: the input in the form of field and laboratory observational methods, the process used in terms of spatial and non-spatial soil inference systems, and the output in the form of spatial soil information systems, which includes outputs in the form of rasters of prediction along with the uncertainty of prediction. We also illustrate the history with a number of sleeping beauty papers that seem too precocious and consequently the ideas were not taken up by contemporaries and largely forgotten. It took another 30 to 40 years before the ideas were rediscovered and then flourished. Examples include proximal soil sensing that was developed in the 1920s, soil spectroscopy in 1970s, and soil mapping based on similarity of environmental factors in 1979. In summary, the coming together of emerging topics and timeliness greatly assists in the development of paradigm. We learned that research and ideas that are too precocious are largely ignored — such work warrants (re)discovery.},

  abstract = {A database of monthly climate observations from meteorological stations is constructed. The database includes six climate elements and extends over the global land surface. The database is checked for inhomogeneities in the station records using an automated method that refines previous methods by using incomplete and partially overlapping records and by detecting inhomogeneities with opposite signs in different seasons. The method includes the development of reference series using neighbouring stations. Information from different sources about a single station may be combined, even without an overlapping period, using a reference series. Thus, a longer station record may be obtained and fragmentation of records reduced. The reference series also enables 1961–90 normals to be calculated for a larger proportion of stations. The station anomalies are interpolated onto a 0.5° grid covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) and combined with a published normal from 1961–90. Thus, climate grids are constructed for nine climate variables (temperature, diurnal temperature range, daily minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, wet-day frequency, frost-day frequency, vapour pressure, and cloud cover) for the period 1901–2002.

  abstract = {The purpose of the present study is preparing a landform classification by using digital elevation model (DEM) which has a high spatial resolution. To reach the mentioned aim, a sub-pixel spatial attraction model was used as a novel method for preparing DEM with a high spatial resolution in the north of Darab, Fars province, Iran. The sub-pixel attraction models convert the pixel into sub-pixels based on the neighboring pixels fraction values, which can only be attracted by a central pixel. Based on this approach, a mere maximum of eight neighboring pixels can be selected for calculating of the attraction value. In the mentioned model, other pixels are supposed to be far from the central pixel to receive any attraction. In the present study by using a sub-pixel attraction model, the spatial resolution of a DEM was increased. The design of the algorithm is accomplished by using a DEM with a spatial resolution of 30 m (the Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer; (ASTER)) and a 90 m (the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; (SRTM)). In the attraction model, scale factors of (S = 2, S = 3, and S = 4) with two neighboring methods of touching (T = 1) and quadrant (T = 2) are applied to the DEMs by using MATLAB software. The algorithm is evaluated by taking the best advantages of 487 sample points, which are measured by surveyors. The spatial attraction model with scale factor of (S = 2) gives better results compared to those scale factors which are greater than 2. Besides, the touching neighborhood method is turned to be more accurate than the quadrant method. In fact, dividing each pixel into more than two sub-pixels decreases the accuracy of the resulted DEM. On the other hand, in these cases DEM, is itself in charge of increasing the value of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and shows that attraction models could not be used for S which is greater than 2. Thus considering results, the proposed model is highly capable of increasing the spatial resolution of DEM (the new DEM with high spatial resolution). In the next step, in order to prepare the geomorphology map using topographic position index (TPI), the DEM with scale factor of (S = 2) was used, touching neighborhood serves as input. The landform classes were extracted by using TPI with the new DEM; consequently, the attraction model extraction showed details of landforms that make them more separable than the landform map prepared by utilizing the 90 m spatial resolution DEM. Moreover, the results showed that the landform of the 90 m spatial resolution DEM (S = 2, T = 2) and ASTER DEM 30 m were similar to each other, these results indicate a high accuracy of the proposed attraction model.},

  abstract = {Landforms and landscape context are of particular importance in understanding the processes of soil genesis and soil formation in the spatial domain. Consequently, many approaches for soil generation are based on classifications of commonly available digital elevation models (DEM). However, their application is often restricted by the lack of transferability to other, more heterogeneous, landscapes. Part of the problem is the lack of broadly accepted definitions of topographic location based on landscape context. These issues arise because of: (1) the scale dependencies of landscape pattern and processes, (2) different DEM qualities, and (3) different expert perceptions. To address these problems, we suggest a hierarchical terrain-classification procedure for defining landscape context. The classification algorithm described in this paper handles object detection and classification separately. Landscape objects are defined at multiple scales using a region-based segmentation algorithm which allows each object to be placed into a hierarchical landscape context. The classification is carried out using the terrain attribute mass-balance index across a range of scales. Soil genesis and transport processes at established field sites were used to guide the classification process.

The resulting maps represent adaptation degrees between classifications and 191 semantically identified random samples. The map with the best adaptation has an overall accuracy of 89\%.},

Previous studies developed the DSMART algorithm (“Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees”) for this purpose. In this study, we tested the sensitivity of DSMART towards the input data by using two different conventional soil maps covering Denmark at scales of 1:1,000,000 and 1:2,000,000. As a potential way to improve the algorithm, we tested an implementation of soil-landscape relationships, using maps of wetlands and soil texture. We also tested two different sampling schemes, generating either a set number of virtual samples per polygon in the input map or a number of virtual samples in proportion to the areas of the polygons. Thirdly, we tested the replacement of the resampling procedure and decision tree model with Random Forest. The original procedure repeated the generation of the virtual samples 50 times, fitting a decision tree in each repetition. We modified it by sampling only once and fitting a Random Forest model. The area-proportional sampling scheme and soil-landscape relationships both improved the accuracy. Random Forest yielded a lower accuracy than the original resampling and decision tree procedure, but was far more computationally efficient. The accuracy also depended strongly on the input maps. In the best case, the algorithm predicted soil types with 18\% accuracy and soil groups with 47\% accuracy. The results demonstrated that there are several ways to improve the disaggregation of conventional soil maps, and that a suitable approach can provide reliable soil maps at a national extent.},

"Several innovative agricultural practices and measures to protect the environment take place at local levels, which has reinforced the demand for high-quality, high-resolution maps of soil properties (Kovacic et al., 2000; Auernhammer, 2001). Researchers have developed several approaches to produce accurate soil maps from point observations (McBratney et al., 2003; Scull et al., 2003). Unfortunately, thefieldwork to acquire soil observations is expensive and time consuming, and it may not be a practical option across large areas."

"We assigned the weights 0.75 to dominant soils, 0.35 to associations and 0.10 to inclusions. Subsequently, we scaled the sum of weights for each map unit to 100\% (Table 1, Table 2). Some map units listed entries that referred to entire soil groups rather than specific soil types. In these cases, we replaced the listed soil group with the most common soil type within the soil group, if the map unit listed other soil types in the same soil group. Therefore, the same soil type can appear more than once in a map unit. If the map unit did not list other soil types within the group, we split the share evenly amongst the soil types of the group."

  abstract = {Models for estimating the spatial distribution of radiation, thermal and hydrologic regimes in topographically complex forested catchments are presented. These models use topographic attributes derived from a grid-based digital elevation model (DEM) as the primary input data. The models are based on simplified representations of the underlying physics of the processes, but include the key factors that modulate system behaviour. They represent an attempt to relate pattern to process. Model SRAD is an approximate method for estimating the spatial distribution of global short-wave radiation, net long-wave radiation, net radiation and maximum, minimum and average temperature, and accounts for the effects of topographic shading. Model WET estimates spatially distributed soil water content and evapotranspiration and catchment runoff`. SRAD and WET were applied to a 21.65 km2 forested area within the Brindabella Range in south-eastern Australia to illustrate the potential applications of the approach. A 20 m x 20 m grid DEM was developed for the area. The computed radiation fluxes are consistent with measurements made at Canberra. The computed average annual runoff'conversionefficiencywas 18.6\%, which compares reasonably well with the annual runoff` conversion efficiency of 17.6\% measured over an 11 year period on a 97.5 ha catchment located near the study area. The study area contains five main sub-alpine forest types, as well as a small area of exotics. The computed fluxes were used to characterize the fine-scale environmental heterogeneity and environmental domains of these forest types. Average minimum temperature in the coldestmonth (July) and annual net radiation were two environmental variables differentiating the occurrence of the three eucalypt species (Eucalyptus paueiflora, E. fastigata and E. delegatensis) investigated.},

  abstract = {The principle of using induction rules based on spatial environmental data to model a soil map has previously been demonstrated. Whilst the general pattern of classes of large spatial extent and those with close association with geology were delineated, small classes and the detailed spatial pattern of the map were less well rendered. Here we examine several strategies to improve the quality of the soil map models generated by rule induction. Terrain attributes that are better-suited to landscape description at a resolution of 250 m are introduced as predictors of soil type. A map sampling strategy is developed. Classi cation error is reduced by using boosting rather than cross-validation to improve the model. Further, the bene t of incorporating the local spatial context for each environmental variable into the rule induction is examined. The best model was achieved by sampling in proportion to the spatial extent of the mapped classes, boosting the decision trees, and using spatial contextual information extracted from the environmental variables.},

  abstract = {ASTER DEM data was used to automate landform classification during soil survey in the Varamin area. For comparison, manual landform classification was done in the same area. Study area was located at South of Jajrood river watershed, Southeast of Tehran province (Iran). The main purpose of this study was to compare the effect of automated and manual landform classification methods in semi-detailed soil survey procedure. Eight geomorphometric parameters were extracted from DEM using the TAS and DiGem software. The Pearson correlation coefficient analysis elucidated that, the most effective of parameters were: analytical hill-shade, plan and profile curvature, and slope and divergenceconvergence index. In addition to these terrain attributes, principal component analyses (PCA) of primary geomorphometric parameters were produced to increase the quality of classification and to reduce modeled data. First three PCAs cover 97\% of variance of the data. These PCAs and mentioned terrain parameters were selected for performing of K-means unsupervised landform classification model. Results indicated that unsupervised and manual classification can be complemented, such that conflation of the final maps obtained by these methods can produce a more accurate map. Also, the Kmeans algorithm with correct iterations, tolerance and suitable number of classes can be used for automated landform classification as well. Hybrid landform classification method is useful for soil survey and soil mapping especially, in watersheds and natural resource fields.},

Supervised learning pattern recognition procedures were applied. Linear discriminant analysis allowed up to \textasciitilde 80\% of correct classification. To improve discriminatory accuracy, another kind of algorithm that can model nonlinear separation among classes was considered: artificial neural networks. This method obtained excellent results, with 100\% of the 140 wines correctly placed into the associated seven classes. Our results are in good agreement with the working hypothesis of differentiation among wines coming from different locations, including both different islands and different sites on Tenerife Island.},

This and its QGIS Python API makes it a perfect candidate for console-based geoprocessing. By establishing an interface, the R package RQGIS makes it possible to use QGIS as a geoprocessing workhorse from within R. Compared to other packages building a bridge to GIS (e.g., rgrass7, RSAGA, RPyGeo), RQGIS offers a wider range of geoalgorithms, and is often easier to use due to various convenience functions. Finally, RQGIS supports the seamless integration of Python code using reticulate from within R for improved extendability.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the use of optical and microwave remote sensing data for soil and terrain mapping with emphasis on applications at regional and coarser scales. Remote sensing is expected to offer possibilities for improving incomplete spatial and thematic coverage of current regional and global soil databases. Traditionally, remotely sensed imagery have been used to support segmentation of the landscape into rather homogeneous soil–landscape units for which soil composition can be established by sampling. Soil properties have also been inferred from optical and microwave data using physically-based and empirical methods. Used as a secondary data source, remotely sensed imagery may support spatial interpolation of sparsely sampled soil property data. Soil properties that have been measured using remote or proximal sensing approaches include mineralogy, texture, soil iron, soil moisture, soil organic carbon, soil salinity and carbonate content. In sparsely vegetated areas, successful use of space borne, airborne, and in situ measurements using optical, passive and active microwave instruments has been reported. On the other hand, in densely vegetated areas, soil data acquisition typically relied on indirect retrievals using soil indicators, such as plant functional groups, productivity changes, and Ellenberg indicator values. Several forms of kriging, classification and regression tree analyses have been used jointly with remotely sensed data to predict soil properties at unvisited locations aiming at obtaining continuous area coverage. We expect that remotely sensed data from existing platforms and planned missions can provide an important data source supporting digital soil mapping. Yet, most studies so far have been performed on a local scale and only few on regional or smaller map scale. Although progress has been made, current methods and techniques still bear potential to further explore the full range of spectral, spatial and temporal properties of existing data sources. For example, space borne spectroscopy has been of limited use in retrieving soil data when compared to laboratory or field spectroscopy. To date, there is no coherent methodology established, where approaches of spatial segmentation, measurements of soil properties and interpolation using remotely sensed data are integrated in a holistic fashion to achieve complete area coverage. Such approaches will enhance the perspectives of using remotely sensed data for digital soil mapping.},

  abstract = {Disaggregation of conventional soil surveys has been identified as a potential source for much of the next generation of model-ready digital soil spatial data. This process aims to apportion vector soil surveys into raster (gridded) representations of the component soils that are often aggregated together in map unit designs. Most soil surveys are published with some description of the soil–landscape relationships that distinguish component soils within map units. We used these descriptions found in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database of Webster and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia, USA, to build a set of representative training areas for all soil components by using 1-arc second digital elevation data and derived geomorphic indices. These training areas were then used in classification tree ensembles with a more extensive environmental database to transform the original SSURGO map into a gridded soil series map. We created underlying prediction frequency surfaces from the models that can be used for creating continuous representations of soil class and property distributions.},

"In the U.S., both the U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2: 1:250,000 scale) and the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO: most commonly 1:24,000 scale, but varies between 1:12,000 and 1:125,000) databases often aggregate multiple soil classes into spatial polygon delineations used in maps (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993; Thompson et al., 2012)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=2}{Nauman et al 2014:386})
\par
"The data model for SSURGO, which is the primary high resolution soil inventory for the US, includes polygonal map units with generally one to four named soil series (soil taxonomic class) per map unit, plus minor inclusions of soils or nonsoil areas, which are sometimes but not always fully documented."

\par
"The problem that now emerges is how to use the wealth of information in legacy soil surveys in an appropriate way. Part of the answer might be to restructure the data to more appropriately address current applications, and one basic step to doing that is to spatially disaggregate the information into its component parts in a manner that better represents how soils truly occur in thefield." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=2}{Nauman et al 2014:386})

"The primary focus of soil survey disaggregation is to express the spatial distribution of soil individuals in cases where older soil maps have lumped them into one spatial unit (Table 1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=2}{Nauman et al 2014:386})
\par
"Generally these techniques also tend to translate the data from object-based polygon maps to grid-based raster formats by using new point or environmental maps (e.g. DEM or satellite imagery) as predictors to map within polygons" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=2}{Nauman et al 2014:386})

"Spatial disaggregation of multi-component soil map polygons into individual component soil classes has been demonstrated in attempts to universally update soil maps (Bui and Moran, 2001; Hansen et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2010), and to create class distinctions within the bounds of original survey map units (e.g. Bui and Moran, 2001; Häring et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2010)."

"The objective of this research was to identify a pragmatic and repeatable method for systematic disaggregation of legacy soil maps. This technique addresses the common situation where an older soil map is available, but more detailed soil spatial data is needed, and too few new soil observations are available to use in geostatistical approaches or for building empirical models" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=2}{Nauman et al 2014:386})

"The'terrace' raster created is actually a stratified relative elevation index that determines how high a pixel is in relation to its neighbors within the context of its slope position, slope gradient, and PI (e.g., for a headwater stream, a smaller neighborhood radius is used for calculating relative elevation than a widefloodplain)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=4}{Nauman et al 2014:388})
\par
"This terrace height raster was created mainly to distinguish levels of terraces in alluvial areas during training area selection for alluvial map units, but also was used for decision tree modeling because it seemed to capture variations in landforms well in non-alluvial areas."

\par
"One logic string of environmental raster value ranges was created for each of these two descriptions.

(\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=4}{Nauman et al 2014:388})
\par
"Then the logic statements from each description were linked together in an'OR' logic string allowing inclusion of pixels that met either of the'AND' strings." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=4}{Nauman et al 2014:388})
\par
"The logic strings that came out of these descriptions within linked records were combined with a logical'OR' so that a cell could meet one set of rules (e.g., general landform) or the other (e.g., hillslope position and curvature) to become a potential training cell for the component linked to those descriptions in the database."

"The translation of these rules to raster values was done by creating a list of unique instances of the descriptions that occurred for all the components through the study area." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=4}{Nauman et al 2014:388})

"Once a list of rules was created for all the components in the survey area, training areas were created for all uniquely named components." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=4}{Nauman et al 2014:388})

"To address a range of training class sizes and overlap in some of the training areas between soil series, it was deemed necessary to adjust the number of pixels selected from the training set for tree building for each soil series or class to be proportional to the original relative area of each series computed from the SSURGO component percentages, similar to Moran and Bui (2002)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=6}{Nauman et al 2014:390})

"With consideration for the large number of training classes and a complicated and geologically stratified study area, a maximum tree depth of 20, a minimum number of samples to attempt a split of 20, and a minimum leaf size of 5 were chosen for tree building."

"Evaluation of the model was done with (i) training set agreement, user's accuracies, and producer's accuracies (Congalton, 1991) of individual trees, (ii) overall comparison of predictions to SSURGO, and (iii) an independent validation dataset of spatially referenced soil pedon data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=7}{Nauman et al 2014:391})
\par

\par
"The transformed designs tended to predict more of the classes well, although those schemes did not increase overall accuracy. We thought that the ability to predict more of the classes well at similar accuracy made the SqRt and Log10 models more useful. Upon visual analysis of output maps, SqRt was chosen over Log10 as the optimal model due to the occurrence of inflated areal extent of minor soils not thought to exist in such extents" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=7}{Nauman et al 2014:391})

"Within these map units the disaggregated map highlights all the named components and also shows inclusions, such as areas of Dekalb, Laidig, and Craigsville in PLF.

\par
"When we compared SSURGO and disaggregation maps directly we recorded agreements of 65.1\% for the Orig model, 61.9\% for the SqRt model, and 56.4\% for the Log10 model. Conceptually, these values are probably low estimates because all map units contain 10\%-25\% "other soils," or inclusions, to which we cannot match predictions unless all inclusions from all map units are added to the database from old soil survey manuscripts that vary with age in format and content. Therefore, we saw these as quite high amounts of correspondence between the original survey and the disaggregated soil-landscape patterns." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UN582DBA?page=9}{Nauman et al 2014:393})
\par
"We also noted that the disaggregated map is much more harmonized across the county line because it is actually mapping soil series, the common unit to both surveys, as opposed to map units (Fig. 6).

"Reshuffled, 9 of 21 sites with prediction frequencies between 90 and 100 were correctly predicted, which translates into a ground truth probability of 43\% for making a correct prediction at sites in that interval (Fig. 8d).

Although CSM have been widely used, they are not suitable to meet growing demands for high resolution soil information at field scales. We present a repeatable method to disaggregate CSM data into \textasciitilde 30-meter resolution rasterized soil class maps that include continuous representation of probabilistic map uncertainty. Methods include training set creation for original CSM component soil classes from soil-landscape descriptions within the original survey database. Training sets are used to build a random forest predictive model utilizing environmental covariate maps derived from ASTER satellite imagery and the USGS National Elevation Dataset. Results showed agreement at 70 percent of independent field validation sites and equivalent accuracy between original CSM map units and the disaggregated map. Uncertainty of predictions was mapped by relating prediction frequencies of the random forest model and success rates at validation sites.},

  abstract = {Fine scale maps of soil properties enable efficient land management and inform earth system models. Recent efforts to create soil property maps from field observations tend to use similar tree-based machine learning interpolation approaches, but often deal with depth of predictions, validation, and uncertainty differently. One of the main differences in approaches is whether to model individual depths of interest separately as ‘2D’ models, or to create models that incorporate depth as a predictor variable creating a ‘3D’ model that can make predictions for all depths. It is unclear how choice of 2D or 3D approach influences model accuracy and uncertainty due to lack of direct comparison and inconsistent presentation of results in past studies. This study compares 2D and 3D methods for mapping soil electrical conductivity (salinity), pH, sum of fine and very fine sands, and organic carbon at 30 m resolution for the upper 432,000 km2 of the Colorado River Watershed of the United States of America. A new, simple, model-agnostic relative prediction interval (RPI) approach to report uncertainty is presented that scales prediction interval width to the 95\% interquantile width of the original training sample distribution. The RPI approach enables direct comparison of uncertainty between properties and depths and is easily interpretable by end users. Results indicate that 3D mapping of soil properties with strong variation with depth can result in substantial areas with much higher uncertainty that coincide with unrealistic predictions relative to 2D models, even though 3D models had slightly better global cross-validation scores. Maps and global model summaries of RPI proved helpful in identifying these issues with 3D models. These results suggest that the use of RPI or similar approaches to evaluate models can identify accuracy problems not evident in global validation diagnostics.},

  abstract = {We present a pattern-based regionalization of the conterminous US – a partitioning of the country into a number of mutually exclusive and exhaustive regions that maximizes the intra-region stationarity of land cover patterns and inter-region disparity between those patterns. The result is a discretization of the land surface into a number of landscape pattern types (LPTs) – spatial units each containing a unique quasi-stationary pattern of land cover classes. To achieve this goal, we use a recently developed method which utilizes machine vision techniques. First, the entire National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) is partitioned into a grid of square-size blocks of cells, called motifels. The size of a motifel defines the spatial scale of a local landscape. The land cover classes of cells within a motifel form a local landscape pattern which is mathematically represented by a histogram of co-occurrence features. Using the Jensen–Shannon divergence as a dissimilarity function between patterns we group the motifels into several LPTs. The grouping procedure consists of two phases. First, the grid of motifels is partitioned spatially using a regiongrowing segmentation algorithm. Then, the resulting segments of this grid, each represented by its medoid, are clustered using a hierarchical algorithm with Ward’s linkage. The broad-extent maps of progressively more generalized LPTs resulting from this procedure are shown and discussed. Our delineated LPTs agree well with the perceptual patterns seen in the NLCD map.},

  abstract = {It is proposed to use the General Systems Theory (open system) approach and the General Theory of Classification to make progress in soil classification. It is shown that on this basis it is possible to develop the theoretical basis for a natural soil-landscape classification system, which could serve as a universal one. The main difference between this classification system and existing ones is in the consideration of the natural soil not only as a self-sufficient system (natural body), but also as a derived element of the natural landscape system, that is, as a result of the interaction of the basic system elements - rocks, air, water and organisms. It follows from this that, since soils are derived landscape elements, their boundaries coincide with the boundaries of the corresponding landscapes, and therefore the successive division of the landscapes into classes and subclasses means the simultaneous division of the associated soils. Thus, the proposed classification system is genetic because it not only divides natural soils according to their properties, but also reveals the relationship between them and the causes (factors) of their formation, as well as between their properties and properties of basic landscape elements. Other distinctive features of the classification system, which determine its structure, content, nomenclature and type, are the distinction between differentiating and diagnostic criteria and the subordination of the selection and ranking of differentiating criteria to the rules. The developed principles of classification were tested when creating a scheme of the classification system for the European part of Russia in the process of multiscale soil-landscape GIS mapping.},

  abstract = {ASTER sensor aboard Terra satellite has a capability of spectral measurement in the thermal infrared (TIR) region with a spatial resolution adequate for geological applications. This paper attempts mapping quarts, carbonate minerals and bulk SiO2 content in silicate rocks with the indices defined for ASTER TIR multispectral data. Silica minerals represented by the commonest mineral on earth, quartz, have a unique spectral property in TIR. They have lower emissivity in ASTER band 10 and band 12 spectral regions than in band 11. All the common carbonate minerals represented by calcite and dolomite have another unique spectral feature. They have low emissivity in ASTER band 14 spectral region, and high emissivity in ASTER band 10 to 13 spectral region. In silicate rocks, the wavelength at trough in TIR emissivity spectra systematically moves to longer as the rock type changes from felsic to ultramafic. The emissivity in band 12 is lower than in band 13 for felsic rocks, and higher for ultramafic rocks. Using the spectral features described above, several indices are defined. They are applied to ASTER Level 1B data in the study areas. The results are compared with the information from the field and the laboratory geological investigations including the TIR spectra of the rocks collected at the site and published geological maps. Potential ability of the indices in mapping quarts, carbonate minerals and silicate rocks is suggested.},

  abstract = {The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) aboard NASA’s Terra satellite measures multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) emission from the Earth’s surface to space. Based on analysis of TIR spectral properties of typical rocks on the Earth, several mineralogic indices including the Quartz Index (QI), Carbonate Index (CI) and Mafic Index (MI) for detecting mineralogic or chemical composition of quartzose, carbonate and silicate rocks with ASTER-TIR data are proposed. These indices are applied to the ASTER-TIR data scenes for selected study areas in China and Australia. The results show that ASTER-TIR can discriminate quartz and carbonate rocks as well as mafic – ultramafic rocks, even with atmospherically uncorrected radiance-at-sensor data. Lithologic interpretations agree well with published geologic data and field observations. The mineralogic indices applied to ASTER-TIR provide one unified approach for lithologic mapping in arid and semi-arid regions of the Earth.},

  abstract = {We present a regionalization of the entire Earth’s landmass into land units of homogeneous landscape patterns. The input to the regionalization is a high resolution Global Land Cover (GLC) dataset. The GLC is first divided into local landscapes – small non-overlapping square blocks of GLC cells. These blocks are agglomerated into much larger land units using a pattern-based segmentation algorithm. These units are tracts encompassing cohesive patterns of land cover and the procedure divides the entire landmass into tracts of land with discernibly different patterns. We characterize a pattern in each unit by a set of 39 landscape metrics. The resulting spatial database of land units is the major product of this study. We make this database freely available to the community in order to provide foundational information for studies aiming at explaining relationships between landscape pattern and ecological process and between the process and patterns and their controlling factors. The procedure of obtaining the database is described, the quality assessment of units delineation is given, and the statistics of the major properties of the units are presented. To showcase the utility of the new database we use it to demonstrate that a variability of geometric configurations of landscape patterns worldwide can be captured in terms of only two variables – complexity and aggregation – as they explain 70\% of the variability. This allows for a meaningful, two-dimensional classification and mapping of landscape patterns on the basis of their geometry. Such mapping reveals that the majority of terrestrial landscapes are characterized by a simple, frequently monothematic, pattern of land cover. Thus, landscapes on Earth are mostly segregated by the land cover type and complex landscapes with a diverse mix of different land cover types are rare exceptions from the prevailing monothematic cover.},

  abstract = {Soil variation is more continuous than discrete and therefore calls for a continuous approach to soil classification. Fuzzy set theory provides such an approach that quantitatively assigns individuals to geographically and taxonomically continuous classes. We hypothesized that the fuzzy-c-means algorithm, based on a fuzzy objective function, could be used to quantify pedons into intragrade and extragrade classes and that minimization of the function would allow for the most "precise" classification, which could be validated by mathematically heuristic methods. These methods assume that local extreme (or abrupt changes) in the value of the objective function or its derivatives indicate optimal grouping. This approach was applied on two transects traversing a subcatchment in the central Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia. The resulting fuzzy soil classes were found to have reasonable spatial continuity and contiguity, which were associated with local variation in slope features and parent material. Thus the approach identified plausible groupings (substructures) among the soil individuals that realistically reflected changes in the external factors (principally landform and lithology) controlling the processes generating the substructures. The structure-factor relationships could be used for further rapid soil pattern recognition embodied in soil classification and mapping.},

Prediction performance by ordinary kriging and universal kriging was comparatively poor as the methods do not use covariation of the predictor variable with terrain attributes. Heterotopic cokriging outperformed isotopic cokriging because the former utilised more of the local information from the covariables. The combined regression-kriging methods generally performed well. Both the regression-kriging model C and heterotopic cokriging performed well when soil variables were predicted into a relatively finer gfidded digital elevation model (DEM) and when all the local information was utilised. Regression-kriging model C generally performed best and is, perhaps, more flexible than heterotopic cokriging.

  abstract = {Legacy soil maps typically consist of a tessellation of polygon soil map unit delineations where the map units consist of a defined assemblage of soil classes assumed to exist in more-or-less fixed proportions. There are several limitations in this kind of mapping approach that relate to the original intent of the soil survey, the effect of mapping scale, and the nature of soil polygon boundaries. Yet perhaps a more fundamental limitation is the fact that most of the time, the soil classes that comprise the soil map units are not mapped individually: in effect their spatial distributions are unknown beyond the qualitative indications given in the accompanying soil map unit report. Spatial disaggregation of soil map units attempts to map the spatial distribution of the individual soil classes that comprise a legacy soil map. We developed an approach called “Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees” (DSMART). DSMART samples the polygons of a legacy soil map and uses classification trees to generate a number of realisations of the potential soil class distribution. The realisations are then used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the individual soil classes. These estimates are mapped as raster grids, which can overcome some of the limitations of mapping scale and polygon boundaries inherent in the original legacy soil map.},

"Then we could summarise these predictions to produce a probability surface for each soil class. Some researchers (for example Bui and Moran, 2001; Bui et al., 1999; Häring et al., 2012) have employed multiple models but only as a means to the end of getting at the modal or most probable soil class for each location.

"The map unit polygons were only used to guide the sampling and not as a covariate in the mapping, for several reasons." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J5Q29LHY?page=3}{Odgers et al 2014:93})
\par
"First, by way of trial and error, when we did include the map unit polygons, they tended to feature very prominently in the decision trees and led to sharp discontinuities in the probability surfaces. Second, the map unit polygons were drawn at a relatively coarse mapping scale, which can have the effect of generalising the variability in the landscape. Third, there is uncertainty in the location of themap unit polygon boundaries (Rogowski and Wolf, 1994). Boundaries are drawn according to expert judgement (Webster, 1973). Misalignment errors can creep in to the digitisation process." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J5Q29LHY?page=3}{Odgers et al 2014:93})

"Choosing equal numbers of points from each soil polygon places equal weight on the information associated with the polygons whereas the regular grid approach placed more weight on larger polygons than smaller ones" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J5Q29LHY?page=4}{Odgers et al 2014:94})

\par
"Although we took the same number of samples from each polygon, the map units are sampled differentially depending on the number of polygons there are per map unit (i.e. map units with many polygons contribute more samples than map units with few polygons). This is similar to the approach Moran and Bui (2002) demonstrated was superior to taking the same number of samples per map unit, although in our case the sampling points are labelled with a soil class from within the respective map units (see Section 2.4.2) rather than the map unit itself."

"Step 3 (Fig. 2) involved allocating a soil class to each sampling point. It was necessary to allocate a soil class to each sampling point arbitrarily because the true soil class at each sampling point is unknown.

"in the absence of any other information, each sampling point in that map unit should have an 80\% chance of being assigned to that soil class. Hence we implemented Approach 2 in DSMART." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J5Q29LHY?page=4}{Odgers et al 2014:94})
\par
"On the other hand if our sampling point had a slope of 20\% and we knew that one or two of the soil classes in the relevant map unit could occur on a 20\% slope then we could narrow down the soil class allocation a bit further, as in Approach 3. This would be suitable if we could translate some characteristics of the typical landscape setting of the soil classes into covariate values for slope, elevation and so-on. It might be especially valuable if we do not really have an idea of what the in-map-unit proportions are, such as may be the case in very coarse scale soil surveys."

  abstract = {It is increasingly necessary to apply quantitative techniques to legacy soil polygon maps given that legacy soil maps may be the only source of soil information over large areas. Spatial disaggregation provides a means of extracting information from legacy soil maps and enables us to downscale the original information to produce new soil class maps at finer levels of detail. This is a useful outcome in its own right; however, the disaggregated soil-class coverage can also be used to make digital maps of soil properties with associated estimates of uncertainty. In this work, we take the spatially disaggregated soil-class coverage for all of Western Australia and the agricultural region of South Australia and demonstrate its application in mapping clay content at six depth intervals in the soil profile. Estimates of uncertainty are provided in the form of the 90\% prediction interval. The work can be considered an example of harmonisation to a common output specification. The validation results highlighted areas in the landscape and taxonomic spaces where more knowledge of soil properties is necessary.},

The second takes each component in turn and kriges it, thereby ltering it from the others.

Chapter 2 covers data visualization, including directions for accessing R open source software (described through Rattle). Both R and Rattle are free to students. Chapter 3 then describes market basket analysis, comparing it with more advanced models, and addresses the concept of lift. Subsequently, Chapter 4 describes smarketing RFM models and compares it with more advanced predictive models. Next, Chapter 5 describes association rules, including the APriori algorithm and provides software support from R. Chapter 6 covers cluster analysis, including software support from R (Rattle), KNIME, and WEKA, all of which are open source. Chapter 7 goes on to describe link analysis, social network metrics, and open source NodeXL software, and demonstrates link analysis application using PolyAnalyst output. Chapter 8 concludes the monograph.
Using business-related data to demonstrate models, this descriptive book explains how methods work with some citations, but without detailed references. The data sets and software selected are widely available and can easily be accessed.},

  abstract = {Modeling soil evolution is an important step towards understanding the complexity of the soil system and its interaction with the other systems. The major challenge confronted by pedologists until now is the ability to develop models capable of describing the complete complexity of the soil system. This paper presents the state of art overview of such a soil evolution model, SoilGen, its applications and limitations. In addition, the paper gives an overview of how the SoilGen model may be linked to landscape evolution models to model soilscape development. SoilGen is a mechanistic pedogenetic model in which soil forming processes such as clay migration, decalcification, carbon cycling, bioturbation, physical and chemical weathering coupled with water flow are simulated at multi-millennium time scale. The model has been calibrated and undergone extensive field testing, giving reasonable results at both pedon and landscape scales. However discrepancies between observed and simulated soil properties such as base saturation (BS), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pH have been reported. These have been attributed partly to simplification of soil forming processes particularly in the weathering and chemical systems. There is therefore a need to extend the description of chemical and weathering systems in the SoilGen model. These extensions will not only improve model performance but will also enlarge its application range in simulating the genesis of typical features of more than half of the WRBReference Soil Groups. We also note here that although landscape evolution models have been successfully applied to model soil production and distribution, simplified and/or incomplete description of soil forming processes remain major limitations. We therefore add to the voices in scientific literature calling for integration of pedon and landscape scale models. In addition there is critical need for high quality chronosequence, climosequence, and toposequence profile datasets to enhance calibration and validation of soil evolution models.},

  abstract = {Soil sodicity, acidity, and salinity are important soil constraints to wheat production in many cropping regions across Australia, and the Australian agricultural industry needs accurate information on their economic impacts to guide investment decisions on remediation and minimize productivity losses. We present a modelling framework that maps the effects of soil constraints on wheat yield, quantifying forfeited wheat yields due to specific soil constraints at a broad spatial scale and assessing the economic benefit of managing these constraints. Of the three soil constraints considered (sodicity, acidity, and salinity), sodicity caused the largest magnitude of yield gaps across most of the wheat‐cropping areas of Australia, with an average yield gap of 0.13 t ha−1yr−1. Yield gaps due to acidity were more concentrated spatially in the high‐rainfall regions of Western Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, and averaged 0.04 t ha−1yr−1 across the wheat‐cropping areas of Australia, whereas the yield gap due to salinity was estimated to be 0.02 t ha−1yr−1. The lost opportunity associated with soil sodicity for wheat production was estimated to be worth A\$1,300 million per annum, for soil acidity, A\$400 million per annum, and for salinity, A\$200 million per annum. The results of this work should prove useful to guide national investment decisions on the allocation of resources and to target areas where more detailed information would be required in order to reduce the yield gap associated with soil constraints on wheat yields in Australia.},

It may take days or weeks to obtain the final maps and to visually evaluate the prediction models when using a desktop workstation. To increase the speed of time-consuming procedures, the use of supercomputers is a common practice. GoogleTM has developed a product specifically designed for mapping purposes (Earth Engine), allowing users to take advantage of its computing power and the mobility of a cloud-based solution. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using this platform for digital soil mapping by presenting two soil mapping examples over the contiguous United States. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of this platform at its current development stage, and potential improvements towards a fully functional cloud-based soil mapping platform.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) has been widely used as a cost-effective method for generating soil maps. However, current DSM data representation rarely incorporates contextual information of the landscape. DSM models are usually calibrated using point observations intersected with spatially corresponding point covariates. Here, we demonstrate the use of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model that incorporates contextual information surrounding an observation to significantly improve the prediction accuracy over conventional DSM models. We describe a CNN model that takes inputs as images of covariates and explores spatial contextual information by finding non-linear local spatial relationships of neighbouring pixels. Unique features of the proposed model include input represented as a 3-D stack of images, data augmentation to reduce overfitting, and the simultaneous prediction of multiple outputs. Using a soil mapping example in Chile, the CNN model was trained to simultaneously predict soil organic carbon at multiples depths across the country. The results showed that, in this study, the CNN model reduced the error by 30 \% compared with conventional techniques that only used point information of covariates. In the example of country-wide mapping at 100 m resolution, the neighbourhood size from 3 to 9 pixels is more effective than at a point location and larger neighbourhood sizes. In addition, the CNN model produces less prediction uncertainty and it is able to predict soil carbon at deeper soil layers more accurately. Because the CNN model takes the covariate represented as images, it offers a simple and effective framework for future DSM models.},

This paper investigated how the ability of upslope area for predicting the spatial distribution of soil properties varies depending on the selection of spatial resolutions of DEM and algorithms. Four soil attributes from eight soil-terrain data sets collected from different environments were used. Five different methods of calculating upslope area were first compared for their dependency on different grid sizes of DEM. Multiple flow algorithms produced the highest correlation coefficients for most soil attributes and the lowest variations amongst different DEM resolutions and soil attributes. The high correlation coefficient remained unchanged at resolutions from 15 m to 50 m. Considering decreasing topographical details with increasing grid size, we suggest that the size of 15-30 m may be most suitable for soil-landscape analysis purposes in our study areas.},

In developing countries, soil erosion is one of the main concerns as it adversely affects agriculture and reduces food production. Therefore, the author presents a particularly relevant approach, as he demonstrates how the C++ programming allows us to identify important erosion stages like detachment and deposition. He does this by assessing the annual rate of soil erosion from the Shakkar River watershed in India using distributed information and applying RS and GIS techniques. He also discusses different approaches that have been proposed to work out the influence of topography on erosion. Simulated and observed data of sediment loss are compared for the period 1992 to 2006.This book provides an easy-to-understand basic piece of soil erosion and hydrological research and reaches out to young researchers and students at the graduate and undergraduate level as well as applicants of soil erosion models.},

The algorithm is unique in that it is applicable to high- or low-density irregular data sets, such as yield data. The algorithm is described and a brief example presented using unprocessed sensor-derived grain yield data. A comparison between the segmentation algorithm and a common classification algorithm (k-means clustering) was done using an aerial normalised differences vegetation index (NDVI) image collected on a 200 ha vineyard in Olite, Southern Navarre, Spain. Classification was performed as a univariate (NDVI) analysis and a spatially constrained analysis. Segmentation and classification were run to find 2, 4, 6, . . ., 24 levels and the effectiveness of the outputs determined by how well it explained the variance in vine trunk circumference, a correlated but independent measurement. The results obtained demonstrated that for a given number of manageable (effective) zones the segmentation outputs were equivalent or superior to the classification outputs for partitioning vine circumference variance. The segmentation output also generated more coherent management units that should facilitate differential management. The algorithm presented is a first generation segmentation algorithm and several aspects still need to be developed, in particular methods for eliminating edge effects and converting management zones into management (treatment) classes. The results of the segmentation algorithm presented here would indicate that with further development, segmentation might provide an alternative and possibly preferable approach to delineating management zones.},

The existing random forest (RF) outlier detection method when used in conjunction with Anselins Moran’s I produced a detection rate (DR) of 89\% with a false positive rate (FPR) of 9.26\%. In comparison, the newly developed methodology which is based on the decomposition of the RF proximity matrix using principal component analysis (PCA) resulted in a DR of 95\% with a lower FPR (6.39\%). Overall, this research has demonstrated the potential of utilizing an unsupervised and accurate RF framework for the detection and mapping of alien invasive plants.},

  abstract = {Spatial assessment of terroir is creating a new possibility for enhancement of high quality agro-food product and to minimize negative environmental effects such as soil degradation and associated risks. The classification and mapping of particular terroir units could be a competitive marketing tool with a major impact on farmers’ incomes. For this purpose, Carré and McBratney (2005) proposed the terron concept to establish combined soil and landscape entities as the first investigative step to identify terroirs. The main objective of the present work was to assemble various environmental factors (i.e. soil, terrain and climate), to identify and then to map terrons in Denmark. First, for representing soil factors, a national soil spectral library was utilized to measure taxonomic distances between 34 Danish reference soil profiles and the Danish national soil profile database (586 soil profiles). Second, the terrain and climate factors for each soil profile location were then compiled as represented by relative slope position, valley depth, valley bottom flatness, vertical distance to the channel network, number of frost days, annual number of growing days, global solar radiation, and precipitation. Third, nine Danish terron classes were established by fuzzy c-means clustering based on an integrated matrix including all soil, terrain and climate factors whereby each terron class is characterized by soil, terrain and climate as a whole entity. Finally, the spatial distribution of Danish terrons was mapped using Cubist regression rules. The results were compared with a soil map derived from the same profile database. We concluded that the map of terrons described natural environment quantitatively and formally in terms of soil, landscape and climatic information better than just a soil class or soil attribute map. Further investigations are needed to discover whether the terron classes give better predictions of landscape-dynamic processes and allow better management options than soil alone. This study also demonstrated several advantages of using soil spectral data and ancillary data to identify and map terrons. The next step will be to validate the terron map by incorporating crop yield data and social factors to delineate natural Danish terroir units.},

  abstract = {An important issue in ecohydrological research is distribution modelling, aiming at the prediction of species or vegetation type occurrence on the basis of empirical relations with hydrological or hydrogeochemical habitat conditions. In this study, two statistical techniques are evaluated: (i) the widely used multiple logistic regression technique in the generalized linear modelling framework, and (ii) a recently developed machine learning technique called ‘random forests’. The latter is an ensemble learning technique that generates many classification trees and aggregates the individual results. The two different techniques are used to develop distribution models to predict the vegetation type occurrence of 11 groundwater-dependent vegetation types in Belgian lowland valley ecosystems based on spatially distributed measurements of environmental conditions. The spatially distributed data set under investigation consists of 1705 grid cells covering an area of 47.32 ha. After model construction and calibration, both models are applied to independent test data sets using two-fold cross-validation and resulting probabilities of occurrence are used to predict vegetation type distributions within the study area. Predicted vegetation types are compared with observations, and the McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model at the 0.001 significance level. Comparison of the modelling results for each individual vegetation type separately by means of the F-measure, which combines precision and recall, also reveals better predictions by the random forest model. Inspection of the probabilities of occurrence of the different vegetation types for each grid cell demonstrates that correct predictions in central areas of homogeneous vegetation sites are based on high probabilities, whereas the confidence decreases towards the margins of these areas. Threshold-independent evaluation of the model accuracy by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirms good performances of both models, but with higher values for the random forest model. Therefore, the incorporation of the random forest technique in distribution models has the ability to lead to better model performances.},

  abstract = {Soil types or map units are considered to be taxonomically adjacent if they differ in only one criterion, defined by an arbitrary threshold value. By treating soil types as nodes of a graph and taxonomic adjacency as the graph edges connecting nodes, algebraic graph theory can be used to produce a measurement of the uncertainty in a soil map associated with arbitrary classification boundaries between soil types. The largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph, the spectral radius, is an indication of network complexity. A larger spectral radius indicates a more complex network, and a greater degree of uncertainty or potential error associated with taxonomic adjacency. Benchmark values of spectral radius for cases of no taxonomic adjacency, including a single pair of adjacent soils, a chain or cycle-type graph structure and a fully connected graph, are established so that taxonomic adjacency indices based on the spectral radius can be established. Examples are shown from two contrasting USA soil landscapes in the Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas, and the coastal plain of North Carolina, using both US Soil Taxonomy and the world reference base. The taxonomic adjacency indices are also useful in assessing soil richness and pedodiversity, with smaller values indicating a greater likelihood that identified soils represent distinct entities.},

  abstract = {Topography of various types and scales can be fingerprinted by computer analysis of altitude matrices (digital elevation models, or DEMs). The critical analytic tool is the geometric signature, a set of measures that describes topographic form well enough to distinguish among geomorphically disparate landscapes. Different surficial processes create topography with diagnostic forms that are recognizable in the field. The geometric signature abstracts those forms from contour maps or their DEMs and expresses them numerically. This multivariate characterization enables once-intractable problems to be addressed. The measures that constitute a geometric signature express different but complementary attributes of topographic form. Most parameters used here are statistical estimates of central tendency and dispersion for five major categories of terrain geometry; altitude, altitude variance spectrum, slope between slope reversals, and slope and its curvature at fixed slope lengths. As an experimental application o f geometric signatures, two mapped terrain types associated with different processes of shallow landsliding in Marin County, California, were distinguished consistently by a 17-variable description of topography from 21 x 21 DEMs (30-m grid spacing). The small matrix is a statistical window that can be used to scan large DEMs by computer, thus potentially automating the mapping of contrasting terrain types. The two types in Matin County host either (1) slow slides: earth flows and slump-earth flows, or (2) rapid flows: debris avalanches and debris flows. The signature approach should adapt to terrain taxonomy and mapping in other areas, where conditions differ from those in Central California.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of soil properties with complete area coverage is needed for policy-making, land resource management, and monitoring environmental impacts. Remote sensing offers possibilities to support Digital Soil Mapping, especially in data-poor regions. The aim of this work was to test the potential of time-series of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation and drought indices to provide relevant information to model topsoil properties in a Boreal-Atlantic region (Scotland) focussing on differentiation between soils with high and soils with low organic matter contents. For each of the three considered years, 345 MODIS data sets were included in the exploratory analysis; 15 data products for 23 dates (bi-weekly) per year. Terrain parameters derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission were also included. A methodology was implemented to exploit fully the high number of covariates, to identify the band, index or product that best correlates with the soil property of interest. In particular the proposed approach i. relies on freely globally available data-sets; ii. uses statistical criteria to select the combination of covariates providing the highest predictive capability, among the data considered and available; iii. deals with both continuous (using Generalized Additive Models, GAMs) and multinomial categorical (using Random Trees) types of variables; iv. takes into account fully the spatial autocorrelation of the data; v. provides estimates of the spatial uncertainty for each pixel; and vi. is computationally efficient when compared with methods such as forward stepwise. The models fitted show a fairly good agreement with existing data sets, presenting a consistent spatial pattern. The use of MODIS data as covariates increased the predictive capabilities of GAMs using only terrain parameters. The misclassification error for organic matter classes was between 25 and 35\%. The assessment provided of the spatial uncertainty of the modelled values can be used in further modelling and in the assessment of consequences of climate-change and trade-off in land use changes. This approach can contribute to improving our understanding and modelling of soil processes and function over large, and relatively sparsely sampled, areas of the world.},

  abstract = {The variation of soil properties down a profile is usually considered continuous. The aim of this study was to develop and test a methodology to model the continuous vertical and lateral distributions of SOC stocks in Scottish soils making explicit the modelling and spatial uncertainty of the results. A comparison with regression kriging and other depth function methods is provided to show that better performances can be achieved taking into account non-linear relationships between covariates and soil properties. The analysis was run for the whole of Scotland. The carbon stocks were calculated for each point, i.e. each horizon in each available profile. The stock value at each cell for each of the considered depth layers was defined using a hybrid GAM-geostatistical 3D model, combining: 1) the fitting of a GAM to estimate the trend of the variable, using a 3D smoother with related covariates; and 2) kriging or Gaussian simulations of GAM residuals as spatial component to account for local details. The use of GAM makes the approach flexible, because it is able to deal with both linear and non-linear relationships between soil properties and the considered covariates. The results confirmed that MODIS data are a useful source of information for DSM especially at national scale. When comparing the proposed approach with similar methods such as regression kriging, the results showed better agreement with the data in the validation set with a global R2 of 0.60. The median values obtained are comparable with the values reported from previous studies on stocks in Scotland using different methods. The uncertainty is large indicating a wide range of credible values for each pixel.},

  abstract = {Pedological assessment and mapping by hyperspectral proximal and multispectral remote sensing comes up as an important alternative for large extent areas with high soil variability. Strategies indicating how to integrate these multi-source data for digital soil mapping are emerging. In this paper, we used proximal and remote sensed data to perform pedological assessments and to support a detailed soil class mapping by MESMA. The study area is located in Southeast of Federal District, Brazil. Six toposequences were defined according to pedomorphogeological assessments and 34 sites were collected for laboratory analysis (texture and chemical) and VIS-NIRSWIR (350–2500 nm) spectroscopy reflectance analysis. We assessed soil mineralogy based on derivative analysis of topsoil reflectance and we grouped observations to recognize topsoil spectral patterns by clustering method. Topsoil patterns (mean spectral curve for each cluster) were convolved using a Gaussian function of Landsat 5-TM spectral bands to obtain endmembers. Then, we used a Landsat 5 TM time series to produce a bare soil composite denominated Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI). Endmembers and SYSI were used as input data for Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to map the soil classes. Topsoil spectra clustered soil samples that were similar in texture, mineralogy and color, and identified 13 topsoil patterns (endmembers). SYSI retrieved 74\% of bare soil area coverage and presented very similar spectral patterns to endmembers. The RGB 543 composite highlighted the mineralogy (i.g. sesquioxides, kaolinite and quartz), texture and color of the soils. MESMA modeled almost 100\% of SYSI from endmembers, with low global RMSE of 0.86\% and high global fraction of 62\%. Soil classes were mapped using topsoil reflectance patterns and satellite images by MESMA method. We validated the digital soil map by using independent field-visited sites, which reached a Kappa coefficient of 0.73. We efficiently assessed soil mineralogy and recognized patterns from laboratory topsoil spectra. We successfully mapped soil classes using topsoil reflectance patterns and a bare soil composite image by MESMA method.},

Within the European FP7 project ‘e-SOTER’, following recognised harmonisation principles, we developed an XML schema to serve as an exchange format for soil and terrain data derived from e-SOTER methodologies (SoTerML). It encompasses existing SOTER database conceptual modelling as well as the WRB (World Reference Base of soil resources) and the FAO soil data structures and classifications, therefore covering major soil and terrain databases such as the European Soil Database (ESD). The flexibility of the modelling achieved is demonstrated from legacy data integrated in the new scheme and made available using an OGC Web Feature Service. Along with the description of SoTerML, the paper aims at pointing out the modelling approach and the modelling principles used for soil and terrain observations, which extracted from our proposal, could prove useful for emerging initiatives towards defining an exchange standard framework for the soil theme.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a quantitative method to classify landforms using four morphometric parameters from DEM-derived thematic raster maps of slope and topographic openness. Because the different surficial processes and stages in the evolution of slopes create landscapes with different shapes, these parameters may lead to a genetic interpretation of topography. The raster maps of slope and topographic openness were constructed for Northeast Honshu, Japan, from 50-m DEMs. The mean and standard deviation of morphometric parameters within a 3050m by 3050 m moving window on the raster maps were calculated. The results for some training areas show that constructional/depositional and erosional landforms with different relief have different morphometric characteristics. A supervised landform classification for Northeast Honshu using the knowledge from the training areas revealed a ladder geomorphological structure composed of high mountains, ranges and volcanoes. The close relationship between the ladder geomorphological structure and volcano distribution indicates that the structure reflects the magmatic plumbing system from the upper mantle to the crust of the Northeast Honshu arc.},

  abstract = {An essential component of soil mapping is classification, a process of assigning spatial soil entities to predefined categories (classes). However, by their nature soils exist as a continuum both in the spatial and attribute domains and often cannot be fitted into discrete categories without introducing errors or at least over-simplification. One approach to mitigate this problem in digital soil mapping is the combination of fuzzy logic-based class assignment with a raster GIS representation model which allows the continuous spatial variation of soils to be expressed at much greater detail than has been achieved in conventional (analog) soil survey. However, applications of fuzzy soil mapping face two significant challenges: defining the central concept of a soil category and determining the degree of membership to the central concept. Prototype category theory is presented here as a potential solution to these difficulties. Emerging from ideas of family resemblance, centrality and membership gradience, and fuzzy boundaries (fuzzy set theory), prototype category theory stresses the fact that category membership is not homogenous and that some members are better representatives of a category than others. A prototype can be viewed as a representation of the category, that 1) reflects the central tendency of the instances' properties or patterns; 2) consequently is more similar to some category members than others; and 3) is itself realizable but is not necessarily an instance. Based on this notion, we developed a prototypebased approach to acquire and represent knowledge on soil–landscape relationships and apply the knowledge in digital soil mapping under fuzzy logic. The prototype-based approach was applied in a case study to map soils in central Wisconsin, USA. Our approach created maps that were more accurate in terms of both soil series prediction and soil texture estimation than either the traditional soil survey or a case-based reasoning approach.},

Soils are spatial entities with fuzzy boundaries. Our study focuses on the uncertainty associated with class assignments when classifying such entities. We first present a framework of knowledge representation for categorizing spatial entities with fuzzy boundaries. Three knowledge discovery methods are discussed next for extracting knowledge from data sources. The methods were designed to maintain information for modeling the uncertainties associated with class assignments when using the extracted knowledge for classification. In a case study of knowledge discovery from an area-class soil map, all three methods were able to extract knowledge embedded in the map to classify soils at accuracies comparable to that of the original map. The methods were also able to capture membership gradations and helped to identify transitional zones and areas of potential problems on the source map when measures of uncertainties were mapped. Among the three methods compared, a fuzzy decision tree approach demonstrated the best performance in modeling the transitions between soil prototypes.},

  abstract = {Maps of soil properties and classes are key inputs to land management, especially with the increasing awareness of ecosystem services provided by soils. Due to limited resources for new soil surveys, legacy soil inventories are often the major public source of soil data, and this is the case in Iran. One line of previous work has presented methods for data archaeology, rescue and renewal, and another line has shown the value of legacy surveys as covariates for digital soil mapping (DSM). The present study therefore aimed to integrate these two streams, adding another step of adequacy evaluation of the rescued surveys according to the Cornell guidelines. The study area is a 10,480 km2 region located at the border of Isfahan and Chaharmahal-va-Bakhtiari provinces, Iran, covered by three legacy studies at the scale of 1: 50,000. The legacy maps were georeferenced and geocorrected, after which the Cornell adequacy guidelines were used to assess the quality of soil unit separation as evaluated at four levels of Soil Taxonomy. Evaluation was by weighted accuracy and the Tau coefficient, based on forty-one legacy soil profiles from a correlation study. The weighted accuracy of the map and the Tau index at all classification levels were respectively greater than 70\% and 50\%, which can be considered as satisfactory separation of soil units. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) predictive models of soil classes with and without the legacy map as covariate were fit. The predictive accuracy of the models was improved at all taxonomic levels when the renewed legacy soil map was included as a covariate. We conclude that the selected legacy soil maps are of reasonable quality and can be used as reliable and useful inputs to DSM, and we propose that these procedures be widely applied.},

  abstract = {We present a model for prediction of pedogenic environments and soil properties based on energy input to the soil system. The model estimates rates of precipitation and net primary production (NPP) energy input using the Parameter-Regression Independent Slope Model (PRISM) climate data, and a parent material index (PMI). Soil order, soil C, and clay data from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database were compared with rates of NPP and precipitation energy input for major geographic regions of the continental USA, including California, Oregon, Washington, Texas, North Dakota, Alabama, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire. Soil orders in all states show differences in total energy input (Ein, kJ mϪ2yrϪ1) and the percentage of Ein from NPP (\%Enpp) (e.g., Ultisols Ein ϭ 29 915, \%Enpp ϭ 49\%; Mollisols Ein ϭ 5880, \%Enpp ϭ 90\%). Using linear regression models, rates of NPP estimated (R2 ϭ 0.82***) trends in soil C content in western states, but failed to estimate soil C in other geographic areas. Parent material index adjusted energy flux estimated soil clay content for the majority (99.5\%) of igneous parent materials in California and Oregon (R2 ϭ 0.67**), the only states with digital geologic data. The model underestimated clay content in steeply sloping Inceptisols and Andisols (0.5\% of igneous land area). Results suggest that rates of NPP may be used to estimate soil C for climate regimes with steep environmental gradients. Landscape age and stability components might improve clay prediction in young and erosive landscapes. Modeled energy input provides a tool for estimating pedogenic environments, soil order, and soil properties. Energy input parameters may aid efforts to pre-map broad landscape units for soil survey.},

  abstract = {Gamma-ray spectrometry is an established method in geo-sciences. This article gives an overview on fundamentals of gamma-ray spectrometry that are relevant to soil science including basic technical aspects, and discusses influencing factors, inconsistencies, limitations, and open questions related to the method. Gamma-ray spectrometry relies on counting gamma quanta during radionuclide decay of 40K, 238U, and 232Th, but secular equilibrium for the decay series of U and Th must be given as decays of their respective daughter radionuclides are used for determination. Secular equilibrium for U and Th decay series, however, is not always given leading to, e.g., anomalies in U concentration measurements. For soil science, gamma-ray spectrometry is of specific value since it does not only detect a signal from the landscape surface, but integrates information over a certain volume. Besides, different spatial scales can be covered using either ground-based or airborne sensing techniques. Together with other remote sensing methods, gamma signatures can provide completive information for understanding land forming processes and soil properties distributions. At first, signals depend on bedrock composition. The signals are in second order altered by weathering processes leading to more interpretation opportunities and challenges. Due to their physico-chemical properties, radionuclides behave differently in soils and their properties can be distinguished via the resulting signatures. Hence, gamma signatures of soils are specific for local environments. Processes like soil erosion can superimpose gamma signals from in situ weathering. Soil mappings, available K and texture determination, or peat and soil erosion mapping are possible applications being discussed in this review.},

  abstract = {Vine size and soil texture effects on yield components, soil, vine tissue, fruit composition, and wine sensory attributes were measured in an Ontario Riesling vineyard to clarify the potential basis for terroir. Sentinel (sample) vines were geolocated using global positioning systems. Geographic information systems delineated spatial variation in soil texture and soil vine tissue composition (1998) and in yield components, berry composition, and weight of cane prunings (vine size) over four years (1998 to 2002) from each sentinel vine. Vines were classified as large or small based on previous season vine size within each of two soil texture classes (clay and sand); fruit from these four categories was separated for winemaking; berry, must, and wine chemical compositional data were determined; and wine sensory descriptive analysis was conduced. Correlations were observed between soil texture and composition versus berry weight and potentially volatile terpenes (PVT). There were no consistent soil texture or vine size effects on berry, must, or wine composition. Large vine size increased berry titratable acidity (TA) (2001) and PVT (2002), decreased must pH (1999), and increased wine free volatile terpenes (2001). Sandy soil reduced wine TA and must PVT (1999) and increased berry TA and must soluble solids (2002). Vine size and soil texture did not consistently affect wine sensory attributes across vintages. High vine vigor decreased mineral aroma (1999) and citrus flavor (2001) and increased apple attributes (2001). Clay soil increased mineral aroma (1999 and 2001) and citrus attributes (1999) but decreased apple aroma (1999). Citrus aroma and petrol flavor increased in some vine size x soil texture combinations in 2002. Vintage and wine age had greater impacts on wine sensory attributes than vine size or soil texture.},

  abstract = {Soil geography should be clearly recognized as a sub-discipline of physical geography and soil science, but at various times over the last century it was accepted as a complementary and descriptive sub-discipline of botany, agronomy and geology. In other words, there was not a clear consensus about its definition and origins. The main goal of this paper is to conduct a historical review (s. XX-XXI) of soil geography to clarify its origin, early methods, first authors and the importance of its interdisciplinary perspective within the scientific community. We found that soil geography was considerably advanced by the work of K.D. Glinka (1867–1927), one of Dokuchaev's students, who could be considered as the father of soil geography. Following the scientific line of Glinka, C.F. Marbut (1863–1935) could be considered one of the first world-reknown soil geographers. During the 1900s, this discipline continued to develop with research conducted by scientists including Kellogg, Simonson, Kubiëna, Huguet del Villar, Fitzpatrick, Duchaufour, Stremme, Zinck and entities such as USDA, FAOUNESCO and CSIRO.},

  abstract = {The aims of this paper are: to compare different data mining algorithms for modelling soil visible–near infrared (vis–NIR: 350–2500 nm) diffuse reflectance spectra and to assess the interpretability of the results. We compared multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), boosted trees (BT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC), clay content (CC) and pH measured in water (pH). The comparisons were also performed using a selected set of wavelet coefficients from a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Feature selection techniques to reduce model complexity and to interpret and evaluate the models were tested. The dataset consists of 1104 samples from Australia. Comparisons were made in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), the corresponding R2 and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Ten-fold-leave-group out cross validation was used to optimise and validate the models. Predictions of the three soil properties by SVM using all vis–NIR wavelengths produced the smallest RMSE values, followed by MARS and PLSR. RF and especially BT were out-performed by all other approaches. For all techniques, implementing them on a reduced number of wavelet coefficients, between 72 and 137 coefficients, produced better results. Feature selection (FS) using the variable importance for projection (FSVIP) returned 29–31 selected features, while FSMARS returned between 11 and 14 features. DWT–ANN produced the smallest RMSE of all techniques tested followed by FSVIP–ANN and FSMARS–ANN. However, both the FSVIP–ANN and FSMARS–ANN models used a smaller number of features for the predictions than DWT–ANN. This is reflected in their AIC, which suggests that, when both the accuracy and parsimony of the model are taken into consideration, the best SOC model was the FSMARS–ANN, and the best CC and pH models were those from FSVIP–ANN. Analysis of the selected bands shows that: (i) SOC is related to wavelengths indicating C―O, C;O, and N―H compounds, (ii) CC is related to wavelengths indicating minerals, and (iii) pH is related to wavelengths indicating both minerals and organic material. Thus, the results are sensible and can be used for comparison to other soils. A systematic comparison like the one presented here is important as the nature of the target function has a strong influence on the performance of the different algorithms.},

Many regions are covered by medium-scale inventories, especially using the SOTER methodology. Largescale digital data are limited to the USA, Canada, Australia and Europe, but there is discrepancy with respect to their philosophies of public access to foundation data such as soil maps. Remaining problems include the lack of metadata, limited interpetations for professionals who are not soil specialists, and geodesic incompatibility with other digital data. The frequent reorganization of websites leads, at best, to user frustration and, at worst, to the disappearance of information.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the accuracy of allocation to classes in monothetic hierarchical soil classification systems, including the World Reference Base for Soil Classification, US Soil Taxonomy, and Chinese Soil Taxonomy, is poorly-served by binomial methods (correct/incorrect allocation per evaluation observation), since some errors are more serious than others in terms of soil properties, map use, pedogenesis, and ease of mapping. Instead, evaluations should account for the taxonomic distance between classes, expressed as class similarities, giving partial credit to some incorrect allocations. These can then be used in weighted accuracy measures, either direct measures of agreement or measures that account for chance agreement, such as the tau index. Similarities can be determined in one of four ways: (1) by the expert opinion of a soil classification specialist; (2) by the distance between classes in a numerical taxonomy assessment; (3) by distance within a taxonomic hierarchy; or (4) by an error loss function. Expert opinion can be from the point of view of the map user, to assess map utility, or map producer, to assess mapping skill. Examples are given of determining similarity between a subset of Chinese Soil Taxonomy classes by expert opinion and by numerical taxonomy from soil spectra, and then using these for weighted accuracy assessment. A method for assessing the accuracy of probabilistic predictions of several classes at a location is also proposed.},

  abstract = {The soil genoform vs. soil phenoform distinction was suggested twenty years ago by Droogers and Bouma to recognize management-induced differences among pedons with the same long-term pedogenesis and included in the same soil map unit, these changes being sufficient to cause important and persistent differences in soil functions. To support the recent increased interest in soil change and soil health, we propose conceptual and operational definitions of soil genoforms and soil phenoforms, and suggest techniques to identify and map them. We define soil genoforms as soil classes as identified by the soil classification system used as the basis for detailed soil mapping in a given area. This avoids the difficulty of defining when human intervention has been sufficient to create new genoforms – by definition this is when new lowest-level classes are recognized in the classification system, based on diagnostic horizons and properties. We then define soil phenoforms as persistent variants of a genoform with sufficient physical or chemical differences to substantially affect soil functions. Soil phenoforms must be persistent enough that substantial management interventions are necessary to change them, thus seasonal and rotational variants are excluded from the concept. Soil phenoforms can be identified by measurements of indicator soil properties at locations within a soil genoform with different management and investigating if these are different enough to affect soil functions, notably soil hydrology and crop yield. Digital mapping of soil phenoforms will likely use maps of current and historical management as predictors. In areas with intensive or changed management, mapping should be repeated every few years to identify areas of changed soil phenoforms and new genoforms.},

  abstract = {Although pedometric approaches were taken as early as 1925, the post-WWII development of information technology radically transformed the possibilities for applying mathematical methods to soil science. The most significant development is the digital computer and associated developments in computer science. These allowed statistical inference on large pedometric datasets, e.g., numerical taxonomy of soils from the early 1960s and geostatistics from the mid-1970s, as well as simulation models of soil processes. By the time of the first Pedometrics conference in 1992 sufficient computing power was available for stochastic simulation and complex geostatistical procedures such as disjunctive kriging. In the intervening 25 years computing power has grown to almost magical proportions, allowing individual scientists to carry out complex procedures. A second development is the growth of networking. This facilitates collaboration among pedometricians, rapid communication with journals, collaborative programming and publication, and easy access to resources. A third development is the availability of on-line storage of large datasets, especially of open data, including GIS coverages and remotely-sensed images. This allows pedometricians working on geographic problems to integrate sources from multiple disciplines, most notably in digital soil mapping using a wide variety of covariates related to soil genesis. It also promotes the an open-source movement of collaborative development of computer programs useful for pedometrics. A fourth development is the wide range of digital sensors which provide data for pedometrics; sensors include spectroscopy, electromagnetic induction, and γ-ray detectors., connected to each other and to central data stores. A fifth development is wireless technology, including mobile computing and telephony, again greatly facilitating rapid and extensive data collection – in pedometrics, the more dense the data, the greater the analytical possibilities and the lower the uncertainty. A final development is a global navigation satellite system (e.g., GPS), making accurate georeference of field data a routine part of data collection, and thereby assuring the highest possible accuracy in maps made by predictive pedometric methods. As computer power increases, models can be correspondingly detailed. As sensor networks and remote sensing provide ever more abundant and spatiotemporally fine-resolution measurements, the challenge is to manage this information and maintain the link with pedologic and soil-landscape knowledge, within the context of societal needs for the results of pedometric analysis.},

The three visible and six near-infrared bands, which have 15-m and 30-m resolution, respectively, were calibrated by using in situ measurements of spectral reflectance. Calcitic rocks were distinguished from dolomitic rocks by using matched-filter processing in which image spectra were used as references for selected spectral categories. Skarn deposits and associated bright coarse marble were mapped in contact metamorphic zones related to intrusion of Mesozoic and Tertiary granodioritic rocks. Fe-muscovite, which is common in these intrusive rocks, was distinguished from Al-muscovite present in granitic gneisses and Mesozoic granite.},

  abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, there is considerable spatial and temporal variability in relations between nutrient application and crop yield, due to varying inherent soil nutrients supply, soil moisture, crop management and germplasm. This variability affects fertilizer use efficiency and crop productivity. Therefore, development of decision systems that support formulation and delivery of site-specific fertilizer recommendations is important for increased crop yield and environmental protection. Nutrient Expert (NE) is a computer-based decision support system, which enables extension advisers to generate field- or area-specific fertilizer recommendations based on yield response to fertilizer and nutrient use efficiency. We calibrated NE for major maize agroecological zones in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, with data generated from 735 on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted between 2015 and 2017. Between 2016 and 2018, 368 NE performance trials were conducted across the three countries in which recommendations generated with NE were evaluated relative to soil-test based recommendations, the current blanket fertilizer recommendations and a control with no fertilizer applied. Although maize yield response to fertilizer differed with geographic location; on average, maize yield response to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were respectively 2.4, 1.6 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Nigeria, 2.3, 0.9 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Ethiopia, and 1.5, 0.8 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Tanzania. Secondary and micronutrients increased maize yield only in specific areas in each country. Agronomic use efficiencies of N were 18, 22 and 13 kg grain kg−1 N, on average, in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, respectively. In Nigeria, NE recommended lower amounts of P by 9 and 11 kg ha−1 and K by 24 and 38 kg ha−1 than soil-test based and regional fertilizer recommendations, respectively. Yet maize yield (4 t ha−1) was similar among the three methods. Agronomic use efficiencies of P and K (300 and 250 kg kg−1, respectively) were higher with NE than with the blanket recommendation (150 and 70 kg kg−1). In Ethiopia, NE and soil-test based respectively recommended lower amounts of P by 8 and 19 kg ha−1 than the blanket recommendations, but maize yield (6 t ha−1) was similar among the three methods. Overall, fertilizer recommendations generated with NE maintained high maize yield, but at a lower fertilizer input cost than conventional methods. NE was effective as a simple and cost-effective decision support tool for fine-tuning fertilizer recommendations to farm-specific conditions and offers an alternative to soil testing, which is hardly available to most smallholder farmers.},

The approach is based on the minimization of an objective function which mixes, via a particular parameter, a classical FCM term and a new entropy regularizer. The main contribution of the method is the introduction of a new exponential form of the fuzzy memberships which ensures the consistency of their bounds and makes it possible to interpret the mixing parameter as the variance (or scale) of the clusters. This variance closely related to the number of clusters, provides us with an intuitive and an easy to set parameter.},

  abstract = {In this study we evaluated whether investing in more spatially detailed environmental covariates improves the accuracy of digital soil maps. We used a case study from Southern Brazil to map clay content (CLAY), organic carbon content (SOC), and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) of the topsoil for a \textasciitilde{} 2000 ha area located on the edge of the plateau of the Paraná Sedimentary Basin. Five covariates, each with two levels of spatial detail were used: area-class soil maps, digital elevation models (DEM), geologic maps, land use maps, and satellite images. Thirty-two multiple linear regression models were calibrated for each soil property using all spatial detail combinations of the covariates. For each combination, stepwise regression was used to select predictor variables incorporated in the model. Model evaluation was done using the adjusted R-square of the regression. The baseline model, calibrated with the less detailed version of each covariate, and the best performing model were used to calibrate two linear mixed models for each soil property. Model parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Spatial prediction was performed using the empirical best linear unbiased predictor. Validation of baseline and best performing linear multiple regression and linear mixed models was done using cross-validation. Results show that for CLAY the prediction accuracy did not considerably improve by using more detailed covariates. The amount of variance explained increased only \textasciitilde{} 2 percentage points (pp), less than that obtained by including the kriging step, which explained 4 pp. On the other hand, prediction of SOC and ECEC improved by \textasciitilde 13 pp when the baseline model was replaced by the best performing model. Overall, the increase in prediction performance was modest and may not outweigh the extra costs of using more detailed covariates. It may be more efficient to spend extra resources on collecting more soil observations, or increasing the detail of only those covariates that have the strongest improvement effect. In our case study, the latter would only work for SOC and ECEC, by investing in a more detailed land use map and possibly also a more detailed geologic map and DEM.},

  abstract = {Conventional soil surveys remain as a major source of information about soils and their properties, but are no longer suited for new demands requiring finer soil data. Spatial disaggregation has been proposed as a way to enrich the resolution of such inventories, in order to better fit the needs for each application. In general, this involves the allocation of individual soil types or their properties within map units based on rules developed from contextual information stored in digital soil geographical databases. However, many countries do not have such soil data infrastructures, thus requiring another strategy for spatially distinguishing individual soils within the polygons of conventional soil maps. Focusing this reality, we developed a disaggregation exercise in a study area located in the wine production zone Serra Gaúcha, Northeast of State Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. We proposed a knowledge-based approach to go around the scarcity of descriptive information, using a heuristic selection of typical sites for each map unit component, based on the survey report and on field observations. A subset of these typical locations was then employed to build a decision tree and to predict individual soil types in the whole study area, using a set of 21 environmental covariates. The spatial detail in predicted maps was considerably improved in relation to the original, while number, proportions and extents of predicted soil types per map unit agreed with the correspondent in the survey report at rates above 70\%. Total extent of each soil type was close to the computed from the original, and results have revealed probable inconsistencies in informed proportions of two similar soils. In comparison to a set of 233 independent pedons, the predicted soil types matched that of the validation points better than each component of the original map units. Furthermore, when applying a framework for assessing soil suitability for viticulture, the predicted maps appeared much more coherent with current land use than when using the original polygons. We concluded that the proposed method is a promising option for disaggregating conventional soil maps with poor descriptive data, and that estimates made by experienced soil surveyors could easily fill in contextual information gaps.},

\par
"The distribution of soils along the landscape is not clearly described as well, like for example relative topographic position, underlying geology, or association to landforms. In certain way, this reflects a trend of Brazilian soil surveys to emphasize soil systematics and morphology in detriment of relation of soils with the environment where they developed."

"To some extent, these manually organized tables were similar to that queried from SSURGO by Nauman et al. (2012), Nauman and Thompson (2014), and Nauman et al. (2014).

\par
"Based on the information previously organized, a visual inspection was conducted for each map unit at a time aiming to identify characteristic slope-landforms combinations per component.

\par
"For example, if two soils had proportions of 60\% and 30\%, they would not need to be kept exactly like that, but thefirst should sum near twice the second. Such characteristic combinations are in fact a conceptual soil-landscape model, since they synthesize an evaluation integrating several environmental variables (Barringer et al., 2008; Nauman et al., 2014)."

"The proportion of individual soils per map unit in the constrained prediction was relatively close to the informed in the survey report (Fig. 4a), with mean absolute error of−2.8\%.

(\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=6}{Sarmento et al 2017:17})

"However, this means not necessarily a problem as some soils in fact may be inclusions who were not mapped due to scale limitations, or that were not found in thefield (Subburayalu et al., 2014)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=6}{Sarmento et al 2017:17})

"From a practical viewpoint, this entails low risk for decision making with any of the disaggregated maps because larger deviations sum a small extent (Rossiter, 2004)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=6}{Sarmento et al 2017:17})
\par
"The reason is that, in the former, a soil that was overestimated in a given map unit forced the others to be underestimated, while in the latter the prediction of additional soils has ever lowered the originals." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=6}{Sarmento et al 2017:17})

"Also, probably many parts of this large map unit were not visited because of the rugged terrain and the forest cover.

\par
"Once a DSM model is built - in our case a decision tree - it is then uniformly applied to the entire study area, which does not happen in manual delineation of soil map units.

\par
"Higher allocation disagreement in non-constrained prediction may be due to a greater number of isolated pixels, what increases the chance of correct predictions to fall around the reference pedons.

Nauman and Thompson (2014) have also found values among 22\% and 24\% for nearest neighbor, and between 39\% and 44\% in a 60-meter search radius, with 87 pedons, using decision trees in West Virginia. Odgers et al. (2014a) achieved 22.5\% of matches with 285 pedons, using an automated approach with multiple decision trees in Queensland," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=9}{Sarmento et al 2017:20})
\par
"Häring et al. (2012) have only accepted prediction probabilities above 0.7 using multiple decision trees in Bavaria, obtaining 70\% of matches with 1820 validation points. Nauman et al. (2014) have found among 66.7\% and 69.8\% of matches with 63 reference pedons using decision trees in Arizona, yet part of the validation points was located in thefield to best represent the target soils in map units."

\par
"It is interesting that, although related to another landscape, our conventional soil map matched the validation points at rates not much different from that achieved by Nauman and Thompson (2014) in West Virginia: only 27\% in map units with a unique named soil, and 39\% for SSURGO components."

\par
"Yet, the spatial distribution of individual soils differs much more between the two disaggregated maps than has evidenced the comparison of proportions and extents of individual soils, and the validation with independent pedons" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=9}{Sarmento et al 2017:20})

\par
"In conventional soil maps, these applications are usually based on the map units assuming the properties of the dominant soil, or weighting by the proportions of their components. Disaggregated maps can be much more effective for such purposes since models or criteria may be applied to the pixel-based, spatially distinguished individual soils, instead of to a whole map unit (Nauman et al., 2012; Kerry et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Odgers et al., 2014b)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=10}{Sarmento et al 2017:21})

"Thus, significant proportions of unsuitable map units (Fig. 10a) in fact seem to be suitable areas (Fig. 10b and c), what shows how much the unknown location of individual soils can harm decision making." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=11}{Sarmento et al 2017:22})
\par
"For example, the confusion between two components of a large map unit has skewed their proportions and extents in relation to the original (Figs. 4, 5 and 6), and lowered accuracy of the predicted maps in relation to the validation pedons (Table 4)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=11}{Sarmento et al 2017:22})
\par
"However, as both the soils at issue are shallow and stony, their apparent misallocation is of low importance for practical purposes as decision making regarding land use (Rossiter, 2004; Phillips, 2013)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H2AC3W46?page=11}{Sarmento et al 2017:22})

\par
"Independent pedons for validation of predictions are of very limited availability as well, but we have found that proportions, number and extent of individual soils, aside of a visual analysis, may provide satisfactory accuracy measurements. If needed, collection of field validation points could be done at low cost, by identifying soils up to the possible taxonomic level based only on morphology."

In the study, the Brovey, the GS, the IHS, and the PCA pan-sharpening algorithms are applied to multispectral (MS) bands of Ikonos and QuickBird images. The spectral and spatial qualities of pansharpened images are tested using the Correlation Coefficient (CC), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). A comparative performance analysis of the CC, the RMSE, and the SSIM shows that the PCA followed by the GS, the Brovey, and the IHS perform the best among all the techniques, except a swap in the PCA and the GS in the SSIM.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that the pedogenic understanding raster classification (PURC) approach can be transferred to a new soil survey project area and that classification tree analysis is a viable alternative to a knowledge-based decision tree for predicting the distribution of soil classes. The new area is in the Green River Basin of Wyoming, USA, which has greater variability in parent material, lower erosion rates and a colder climate than the Powder River Basin of Johnson County, Wyoming, where the PURC approach was developed. There is also a lack of existing soil survey data within or adjacent to the new study area. Topographic data derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and various band combinations and ratios of Landsat 7 remotely sensed spectral data were selected to represent soil-forming factors. Unsupervised classification techniques were used in the preliminary stage of the methodology to recognise existing soil-landscape patterns and to develop an initial sampling plan. Knowledge-based classification and classification tree analysis were used to develop models predicting soil delineations and quantifying soil map unit concepts. The output images generated from the knowledge-based and classification tree models produced similar predictions of soil patterns across the landscape, with slightly different predictions of soil map units. However, the knowledge-based model was much more time-intensive than the classification trees, and failed to classify all pixels within the study area even after multiple iterations of the model. Classification tree analysis was successfully integrated into the methodology, and is more objective than the knowledge-based classification. Although finals maps were slightly different, both models were transparent and could be further refined as additional data becomes available or as land-use needs change.},

  abstract = {In this article, we introduce, evaluate, and apply a new ordinally based soil Productivity Index (PI). The PI uses family-level Soil Taxonomy information, that is, interpretations of features or properties, recognized in Soil Taxonomy, that tend to be associated with low or high soil productivity, to rank soils from 0 (least productive) to 19 (most productive). The index has a wide application generally at landscape scales. Unlike competing indexes, it does not require copious amounts of soil data, for example, pH, organic matter, or cation exchange capacity, in its derivation. Geographic information system applications of the PI, in particular, have great potential. Results confirmed that for 1,000 sites in southern Michigan, the mean PI of cultivated sites is significantly higher (10.94) than that of forested sites (7.77). We also compared the PI with published productivity values for Illinois soils. The positive statistical correlations that resulted confirmed that the PI is an effective measure of productivity for areas that do not have robust productivity data or a wealth of local soil knowledge, as does Illinois. Last, 2009 crop yield data for 11 Midwestern states were used to further evaluate the PI. In a geographic information system, we determined the soils and crops in particular fields and thus were able to ascertain the mean PI value per soil, per crop, per county. Statewide summaries of these data produced statistical correlations among yields of specific crops and PI values that were all positive; many exceeded 0.60. For regionally extensive applications, the PI may be as useful and robust as other indexes that have much more exacting data requirements.},

  abstract = {Land elements have been used as basic landform descriptors in many science disciplines, including soil mapping, vegetation mapping, and landscape ecology. We describe an approach in terrain classification, with the objective of deriving a method for classifying land elements from DTMs based on their fundamental characteristics. The methodology for modelling land elements is implemented as a two-step process: first, form elements are classified based on local geometry, and second, land elements are derived by evaluating the form elements in their landscape context. Form elements are derived by fuzzy classification of slope and curvature at a specified global scale (window size). The form elements are reclassified according to their geomorphometric context using a higher scale terrain position index. The resulting land elements are evaluated with respect to their predictive value for modelling soil properties. It is shown that scaling geomorphometric properties is important for applying them to predict soil properties and to model landform units. The presented model, based on scaled geomorphometric properties and geomorphometric context, using a limited number of model parameters, is capable of modelling fundamental land elements that can be utilized in soil – landscape modelling and in other applications in land resource management.},

We approximate terrain surfaces locally to calculate surface derivatives at different window sizes.

  abstract = {The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU) has been highly successful in securing the supply of food from Europe’s agricultural land. However, new expectations have emerged from society on the functions that agricultural land should deliver, including the expectations that land should regulate and purify water, should sequester carbon to contribute to the mitigation of climate change, should provide a home for biodiversity and allow for the sustainable cycling of nutrients in animal and human waste streams. Through a series of reforms of the CAP, these expectations, or ‘societal demands’ have translated into a myriad of EU and national level policies aimed at safeguarding the sustainability and multifunctionality of European agriculture, resulting in a highly complex regulatory environment for land managers. The current reform of the CAP aims to simultaneously simplify and strengthen policy making on environmental protection and climate action, through the development of Strategic Plans at national level, which allow for more targeted and context-specific policy formation. In this paper, we contribute to the knowledge base underpinning the development of these Strategic Plans by mapping the variation in the societal demands for soil functions across EU Member States, based on an extensive review of the existing policy environment relating to sustainable and multifunctional land management. We show that the societal demands for primary production, water regulation and purification, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and nutrient cycling vary greatly between Member States, as determined by population, farming systems and livestock densities, geo-environmental conditions and landscape configuration. Moreover, the total societal demands for multifunctionality differs between Member States, with the lowest demands found in Member States that have designated the higher shares of EU CAP funding towards ‘Pillar 2′ expenditure, aimed at environmental protection and regional development. We review which lessons can be learnt from these observations, in the context of the proposals for the new CAP for the period 2021–2027, which include enhanced conditionality of direct income support for farmers and the instigation of eco-schemes in Pillar 1, in addition to Agri-Environmental and Climate Measures in Pillar 2. We conclude that the devolution of planning to Strategic Plans at national level provides an opportunity for more effective and targeted incentivisation of sustainable land management, provided that these plans take account for variations in the societal demand for soil functions, as well as the capacity of contrasting soils to deliver on this multifunctionality.},

  abstract = {Predictive soil mapping (PSM) can be defined as the development of a numerical or statistical model of the relationship among environmental variables and soil properties, which is then applied to a geographic data base to create a predictive map. PSM is made possible by geocomputational technologies developed over the past few decades. For example, advances in geographic information science, digital terrain modeling, remote sensing, fuzzy logic has created a tremendous potential for improvement in the way that soil maps are produced. The State Factor soil-forming model, which was introduced to the western world by one of the early Presidents of the American Association of Geographers (C.F. Marbut), forms the theoretical basis of PSM. PSM research is being driven by a need to understand the role soil plays in the biophysical and biogeochemical functioning of the planet. Much research has been published on the subject in the last 20 years (mostly outside of geographic journals) and methods have varied widely from statistical approaches (including geostatistics) to more complex methods, such as decision tree analysis, and expert systems. A geographic perspective is needed because of the inherently geographic nature of PSM.},

  abstract = {Classification tree analysis is evaluated as a predictive soil mapping technique for developing a preliminary soil map for neighboring site from samples extracted from an existing soil map. The objective of the research is to help guide future soil mapping in a nearby area. In order to determine the best overall modeling approach several variations were explored: the dependent variable (soil map class) was grouped at several hierarchical levels (according to Soil Taxonomy), sensitivity analysis was performed on the predictor variables (environmental variables acting as surrogates for soil forming factors), and the study area was divided into meaningful sub-areas (mountains and basins). Soil great group was discovered the most parsimonious dependent variable based on model results (misclassification error rate of 30.0\% based on a test data set). Geomorphology (as measured by several landform variables) best explains the distribution of soil types. The terrain analysis variables did not explain a large amount of variance within the models. Dividing the study area in two separate modeling units increased overall model accuracy. Our results suggest that soil taxonomic class can be predicted with reasonable accuracy from environmental variables. In addition, the technique can provide limited insight into the variables that are most responsible for driving soil development in a given area. This technique could be used in soil survey to extrapolate obvious soil landscape relationships from one site to another, allowing soil experts to concentrate their field mapping effort in unique areas.},

  abstract = {Previous work has been put into the creation of a comprehensive soil classification system (CSCS) using a harmonised dataset of 23 soil properties at 18 depth intervals. The classification consists of selected soil taxa from the US Soil Taxonomy, World Reference Base for Soil Resources, the Australian Soil Classification, and the New Zealand Soil Classification. In this paper, the CSCS was tested for allocation using data for from 44 soil profiles collected in Iran. A distance-based algorithm was used to allocate and name the soil profiles according to the CSCS. It was found that 36 Iranian soil profiles are close to the existing taxa of the CSCS in the taxonomic space. Three Iranian profiles with distances between 25 and 30 taxonomic units to the closest CSCS taxa were added to the CSCS and assigned with new systematic names. Allocating the remaining 5 Iranian taxa would require regenerating the nomenclature system. The CSCS has shown advantages for allocating soil profiles from other regions of the world other than the USA, Australia and New Zealand. It also enables cross-referencing with existing soil classification systems. In the future, the CSCS can be further improved by adding taxa from other global or regional soil classification systems.},

  abstract = {Considering the nature of soils distribution, an important modeling issue in soil class mapping is imbalanced class observations. Imbalanced number of data in observed soil classes in an area can result in the underestimation or loss of minority classes and an overestimation of the majority classes in predictive modeling. The effect of this phenomenon is that an area of land with comparatively fewer soil profile observations could be unmapped in the digital maps. To address this problem, this paper investigated the usefulness of data pretreatment techniques called over- and under-sampling of data applied on three predictive models including decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), and multinomial logistic regression (MNLR). The study area is situated in the northwest of Iran with 452 profiles observations on a regular grid covering about 12,000 ha. This area has 8 USDA soil great groups with an imbalanced frequency distribution. Results showed that modeling using imbalanced distribution of class observation caused uncertain maps with minority classes being lost and relatively poor accuracies. After data treatment, with over- and under-sampling, all models showed significant improvement in maintaining the minority classes, in both calibration and validation evaluations. Balancing the classes led to a notable decrease in uncertainty of all 3 models by decreasing the confusion index and raising the probability of occurrence for the soil classes in the final maps. Comparing the 3 models, decision trees showed the largest calibration and validation accuracies with and without data treatment. RF has an issue of overestimation of some of the majority classes. Data resampling technique can be a useful solution for dealing with imbalanced class observations to produce more certain digital soil maps.},

  abstract = {Class imbalance is a problem in spatial predictive models; it occurs when classes with a large number of observations dominate the prediction and classes with much less number of observations are not predicted at all. It is a crucial topic as imbalanced distribution of soil classes occurs naturally. In this study, we address this problem using Markov chain random field modeling combined with a data resampling technique, i.e., random oversampling. The study area is about 12,000 ha with imbalanced distribution of eight soil great groups located in the northwest of Iran. Four algorithms were used to interpolate class observations, including fixed-path and random-path Markov chain random fields (FPth and RPth, respectively), indicator kriging simulation (IKS) and Markovian-type categorical simulation (MCS). All of the models provide prediction and simulation as outputs. The random oversampling technique was applied to the minority soil classes prior to modeling. Using original data that have imbalanced classes for mapping resulted in loss of the minority classes and relatively low Kappa agreement values for some models. Data oversampling increased overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient for FPth and RPth models. In addition, it led to the maintenance of one or two minority classes in the resulting maps. Overall, RPth model showed the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient both in prediction (overall = 50\%, K = 0.33) and simulation (overall = 52\%, K = 0.36) outputs after data oversampling. Markov chain models combined with data oversampling technique can be used for mapping imbalanced soil classes.},

It is not, though, a review article due to the fact that a huge volume of work exists all over the world and a simple lining up of the related papers would not contribute to an understanding of the usefulness of VIs.

  abstract = {The application of quantitative methods to digital soil and geomorphological mapping is becoming an increasing trend. One of these methods, Geomorphons, was developed to identify the ten most common landforms based on digital elevation models. This study aimed to make a quantitative assessment of the relationships between Geomorphons units, determined at three spatial resolutions and nine radii, and soil types and properties of two watersheds with different soil-landscape relationships in Brazil to help soil surveying and mapping under tropical conditions. The study was conducted at Lavrinha Creek (LCW) and Marcela Creek (MCW) watersheds, located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Spatial resolutions of 10, 20 and 30 m were the basis for generating Geomorphons at 9 radii of calculation for the watersheds. They were overlapped to detailed soil maps of the watersheds and a chi-square test was carried out to assess their relationship with soil types. Observation points were compared with the most highly correlated Geomorphons to also assess relationships with soil properties. Geomorphons with resolution of 30-m and radii of 20 and 50 cells, respectively for LCW and MCW, were more highly correlated with the variability of soil types, in accordance with the terrain features of these watersheds. The majority of observation points for each soil type was located in the same Geomorphon unit that was dominant when analyzing soil maps. There was less variability in soil properties between Geomorphon units, which was probably due to the highly weathered-leached stage of soils. Geomorphons can help to improve soil maps in tropical conditions when assessing soil variability due to its high correlation with tropical soil types variability.},

KnowledgeMiner and decision trees were employed to retrieve information per soil class and soil maps were created per method. A field validation of 20 samples was chosen by a cost-constrained conditioned Latin hypercube sampling scheme and the accuracy of all maps was assessed using a global index, Kappa index, and errors of omission and commission. The KnowledgeMiner MUP map had a greater accuracy than the other methods, being even more accurate than the original map, accounting for 80\% of global index and a Kappa index of 0.6524. The information extracted by KnowledgeMiner provided rules for mapping the watershed surroundings with 70.97\% of global index and a kappa index of 0.5586. Legacy soil data extracted by KnowledgeMiner from a detailed soil map and used to model soil class distribution outperformed decision trees, promoted improvements on the existing soil map, and allows for the creation of a low cost soil map for the surroundings of the study area.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a particular approach to assess information about soil degradation, based on a methodology to calculate soil color from NOAA/AVHRR data. As erosive processes change physical and chemical properties of the soil, altering, consequently, the superficial color, monitoring the change in color over time can help to identify and analyze those processes. A relationship among the soil color (described in the Munsell Color System, i.e., in terms of Hue, Value and Chroma), vegetation indices, surface temperature and emissivity has been established, which is based on the theoretical model. The methodology has three main phases: determination of the regression models among soil color and vegetation indices, emissivity and surface temperature; generation of digital soil color models; and statistical evaluation of the estimated color. The tests showed that the methodology is efficient in determining soil color using the various vegetation indices (i.e., Normalized vegetation index NDVI, Modified soil adjusted vegetation index MSAVI). One vegetation index, i.e., Purified adjusted vegetation index (PAVI) is proposed to subsidies the effect of vegetation over the soil. Best results were obtained for the Hue color component. To further test the methodology, the estimated digital color models were compared with the characteristic color of soil classes in the test area. The results of this application confirmed the methodologyÕs capacity to determine the soil color from NOAA/AVHRR data. This type of study is quite helpful to know the erosion of soil as well as some abrupt change in soil due to natural hazards by space borne or air-borne sensors.},

  abstract = {The open-source programming language R has gained a central place in the hydrological sciences over the last decade, driven by the availability of diverse hydro-meteorological data archives and the development of open-source computational tools. The growth of R’s usage in hydrology is reflected in the number of newly published hydrological packages, the strengthening of online user communities, and the popularity of training courses and events. In this paper, we explore the 5 benefits and advantages of R’s usage in hydrology, such as: the democratization of data science and numerical literacy, the enhancement of reproducible research and open science, the access to statistical tools, the ease of connecting R to and from other languages, and the support provided by a growing community. This paper provides an overview of important packages at every step of the hydrological workflow, from the retrieval of hydro-meteorological data, to spatial analysis and cartography, hydrological modelling, statistics, and the design of static and dynamic visualizations, presentations and documents. 10 We discuss some of the challenges that arise when using R in hydrology and useful tools to overcome them, including the use of hydrological libraries, documentation and vignettes (long-form guides that illustrate how to use packages); the role of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs); and the challenges of Big Data and parallel computing in hydrology. Last, this paper provides a roadmap for R’s future within hydrology, with R packages as a driver of progress in the hydrological sciences, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) providing new avenues for data acquisition and provision, enhanced teaching of 15 hydrology in R, and the continued growth of the community via short courses and events.},

  abstract = {Terrain characteristics, such as slope gradient, slope aspect, profile curvature, contour curvature computed from digital elevation model (DEM), are among the key inputs to digital soil surveys based on geographic information systems (GIS). These terrain attributes are computed over a neighborhood (spatial extent). The objective of this research was to investigate the combined effect of DEM resolution and neighborhood size on digital soil surveys using the Soil–Landscape Inference Model (SoLIM) approach. The effect of neighborhood size and DEM resolution on digital soil survey was examined through computing the required terrain attributes using different neighborhood sizes (from 3 to 54 m) for 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 27 m resolution DEM. These attributes were then compiled and used to digitally map soils using the SoLIM approach. Field work completed on a hillslope in Dane County, WI in the summer of 2003 was used to validate each of the SoLIM derived soil surveys for accuracy. The results of the soil survey validations suggest that there is a range of neighborhood sizes that produces the most accurate results for a given resolution DEM. This range of neighborhood sizes, however, varies from landscape to landscape. When the soils on a gently rolling landscape were mapped, the neighborhood sizes that produced the most accurate results ranged from about 33–48 m. When soils on short, steep backslope positions were mapped, the neighborhood size values that produced the most accurate results range from about 24–36 m. This paper also shows that it is not always the highest resolution DEM that produces the highest accuracy. Knowing which DEM resolution and neighborhood size combinations produce the most accurate digital soil surveys for a particular landscape will be extremely useful to users of GIS-based soil-mapping applications. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Selective landform facet classes and additional co-variates including solar radiation and ecological subzones are used as input variables to ArcSIE software to predict the occurrence of individual soil series and their attributes over a semi-arid high relief watershed of approximately 8,200 km2 in southern British Columbia. A second initiative evaluates techniques utilizing map components from the 1:1,000,000 Soil Landscapes of Canada map series to predict soil attributes on a 100 m DEM. The province-wide prediction efforts address some of the key data and methodological challenges facing the GlobalSoilMap.net project for the mountainous western Canadian landscape where soil maps are readily available for many areas but point (pedon) data are limited.},

  abstract = {In the initial phase of a national project to map clay, sand and soil organic matter (SOM) content in arable topsoil in Sweden, a study area in south-west Sweden comprising about 100 000 ha of arable land was assessed. Models were created for texture, SOM and two estimated variables for lime requirement determination (target pH and buffering capacity), using a data mining method (multivariate adaptive regression splines). Two existing reference soil datasets were used: a grid dataset and a dataset created for individual farms. The predictor data were of three types: airborne gamma-ray spectrometry data, digital elevation from airborne laser scanning, and legacy data on Quaternary geology. Validations were designed to suit applicability assessments of prediction maps for precision agriculture. The predictor data proved applicable for regional mapping of topsoil texture at 50 9 50 m2 spatial resolution (root mean square error: clay = 6.5 \%; sand = 13.2 \%). A novel modelling strategy, ‘Farm Interactive’, in which soil analysis data for individual farms were added to the regional data, and given extra weight, improved the map locally. SOM models were less satisfactory. Variable-rate application files for liming created from derived digital soil maps and locally interpolated soil data were compared with ‘ground truth’ maps created by proximal sensors on one test farm. The Farm Interactive methodology generated the best predictions and was deemed suitable for adaptation of regional digital soil maps for precision agricultural purposes.},

  abstract = {Precision agriculture (PA) is becoming an essential practice for the implementation of sustainable agriculture that encompasses the efficient use of resources and a systematic crops monitoring. The increasing temporal and spatial resolution of satellite imagery, coupled with their availability and decreasing costs, create new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on different crops variables, more frequently available as ready-to-use data. The availability of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, such as the WorldView-3 (WV-3), leads to the advanced potential of satellite Remote Sensing (RS), becoming in the last decade one of the main data source in precision agriculture (PA). In the broad overview of these procedures, geographic object-based image classification (GEOBIA) techniques, gained broad interest as methods to produce geographic information in GISready format. In this paper, methodologies for a semiautomatic process workflow is presented, providing olive tree crown detection in two different olive orchards in Calabria (Italy), collected by means of GEOBIA procedures, in order to investigate olive tree spectral behavior and the reliability of WW-3 derived vegetation indices (VIs). The semi-automated classification method, accomplished by imagery pre-processing steps, may constitute an operational processing chain for mapping and monitoring olive orchards at tree scale detail. Five VIs were investigated: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index 2 (MSAVI 2), Normalized Difference Red Edge Vegetation Index (NDRE), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index Improved (MCARI2), and NDVI2. The obtained results were statistically tested and their accuracy assessed. Thematic accuracy ranges from 95.33\% to 96\% in both study areas with an overall tree detection rate of 96.8\%. Statistical analysis showed that the major differences in spectral behavior, over different plots of the investigated olive orchards, are mainly due to the component of the red-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (EM), where the red-edge becomes important in assessing the state of general vigor. Moreover, the proposed methodology increases the possibility of detecting tree stress at earlier stages and the benefits of using satellite-based approaches in terms of: larger area coverage, less processing and operator interaction coupled with more spectral information, thus reducing the need to collect costly reference data sampling.},

  abstract = {Noise in topographic data obscures features and increases error in geomorphic products calculated from DEMs. DEMs produced by radar remote sensing, such as SRTM, are frequently used for geomorphological studies, they often contain speckle noise which may significantly lower the quality of geomorphometric analyses. We introduce here an algorithm that denoises three-dimensional objects while preserving sharp features. It is free to download and simple to use. In this study the algorithm is applied to topographic data (synthetic landscapes, SRTM, TOPSAR) and the results are compared against using a mean filter, using LiDAR data as ground truth for the natural datasets. The level of denoising is controlled by two parameters: the threshold (T) that controls the sharpness of the features to be preserved, and the number of iterations (n) that controls how much the data are changed. The optimum settings depend on the nature of the topography and of the noise to be removed, but are typically in the range T = 0.87–0.99 and n = 1–10. If the threshold is too high, noise is preserved. A lower threshold setting is used where noise is spatially uncorrelated (e.g. TOPSAR), whereas in some other datasets (e.g. SRTM), where filtering of the data during processing has introduced spatial correlation to the noise, higher thresholds can be used. Compared to those filtered to an equivalent level with a mean filter, data smoothed by the denoising algorithm of Sun et al. [Sun, X., Rosin, P.L., Martin, R.R., Langbein, F.C., 2007. Fast and effective feature-preserving mesh denoising. IEEE Transactions on Visualisation and Computer Graphics 13, 925–938.] are closer to the original data and to the ground truth. Changes to the data are smaller and less correlated to topographic features. Furthermore, the featurepreserving nature of the algorithm allows significant smoothing to be applied to flat areas of topography while limiting the alterations made in mountainous regions, with clear benefits for geomorphometric analysis in areas of mixed topography. The results of denoising on the derived flow accumulation and slope maps, particularly when compared to the results of mean filtering, demonstrate the usefulness of the algorithm in fields such as hydrological modelling and landslide prediction.},

"When removing speckle, the aim is to remove the noise without over-smoothing the data and softening sharp topographic features. Sharp features are particularly important in understanding the geomorphology of areas where landscape evolution is dominated by landsliding, leading to the development of long, straight slopes separated by sharp features such as ridge crests, valley bottoms, the bases of slopes and fault scarps" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95YDY688?page=1}{Stevenson et al 2010:238})

"Sun et al. (2007) developed an algorithm to remove random, spatially uncorrelated noise from three-dimensional surface meshes such as those used in computer-aided design, hand-held laser scanning and computer graphics." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95YDY688?page=2}{Stevenson et al 2010:239})
\par
"While smoothing of data involves removing high-frequency information, denoising aims to preserve genuine information at all frequencies, particularly sharp edges or corners. The algorithm works by altering the positions of the vertices of the triangles that form the mesh (the original data points) such that the orientation of the normal vector to any given triangular face is calculated from a weighted average of the orientations of the normal vectors of those faces with which it shares a vertex (Fig. 1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95YDY688?page=2}{Stevenson et al 2010:239})
\par
"Denoising is carried in two steps that are applied iteratively. Firstly, the new orientations of the face normals are calculated from a weighted average of the normals of adjacent faces (the normal filtering stage; n iterations), then secondly, the corresponding vertex locations are obtained (the vertex updating stage; v iterations)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95YDY688?page=2}{Stevenson et al 2010:239})
\par
"Normals most closely aligned with that of the face under consideration are weighted most strongly. Those that differ by more than a permitted amount (which is controlled by a user-defined threshold value, T, which is the cosine of the maximum permitted angle between the normals of two supposedly co-planar adjacent faces) are assumed to belong to the wrong side of a sharp edge or corner and are given a weighting of zero. Higher values of T are used to preservefiner details in the data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95YDY688?page=2}{Stevenson et al 2010:239})
\par
"In contrast, natural topographic surfaces are complex, exhibiting some self-affine behaviour with relief at all length scales (Turcotte, 2007) and local gradients controlled in rocky terrain by local factors (Anderson, 1994). Thus the challenge for any algorithm working on topographic data is to remove the high-frequency noise while preserving small scale features" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95YDY688?page=2}{Stevenson et al 2010:239})
\par
"In this study, the denoising algorithm of Sun et al. (2007) is applied to a variety of raster (gridded) topographic datasets (Table 1). Raster data were used because such data and the tools for processing them are more commonly available than mesh or triangular irregular network (TIN) data, but the results are applicable to both types of data."

\par
"One hundred normal updating and vertex updating iterations were used (n=v=100). The aim of using so many iterations was to allow the algorithm to converge on a stable solution, to illustrate which features were preserved at different settings of the threshold parameter" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/95YDY688?page=5}{Stevenson et al 2010:242})

  abstract = {Agricultural soil quality (SQ) research has focused on the in¯uence of individual soil properties, particularly those related to soil organic matter (SOM), on soil processes such as water movement and retention, and nutrient cycling. However, few studies have assessed the in¯uence of these SOM-related properties on crop productivity, particularly under different management systems. Furthermore, agricultural SQ research in tropical regions is limited. The objectives of this study were, for a tropical site, to determine (1) the relationship between selected soil characteristics and resulting soil functional properties such as aggregate stability and porosity, and (2) the relationship between SQ indicators and productivity of corn under three different tillage systems. Twelve plots were randomly demarcated in three adjacent ®elds under different tillage systems. Pro®les were described by augering and the surface soil (0±7.5 cm) was sampled just prior to crop harvest and analyzed for texture, standard soil tests (pH, available P, K, Mg and Ca) and SQ parameters including total N, total and active fraction C, porosity and aggregate stability. Corn dry grain m±2, above-ground crop dry matter m±2, and dry grain per plant was measured in each plot. Soil C parameters were highly predictive of macroaggregate stability and soil porosity across different tillage systems. Macroaggregate stability and soil C (particularly active C oxidizable by 0.025 m KMnO4) were highly correlated with crop productivity across tillage systems. These ®ndings suggest that soil C in the surface layer, especially the active C fraction, markedly affected the productivity of this tropical soil through its in¯uence on soil structure.},

  abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.
Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand.
Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research.},

Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables.
Results: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure.
Conclusion: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

The original Fortran programs carried out new cluster analysis algorithms introduced in the book of Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990). These clustering methods were designed to be robust and to accept dissimilarity data as well as objects-by-variables data. Moreover, they each provide a graphical display and a quality index reflecting the strength of the clustering. The powerful graphics of S-PLUS made it possible to improve these graphical representations considerably. The integration of the clustering algorithms was performed according to the object-oriented principle supported by S-PLUS. The new functions have a uniform interface, and are compatible with existing S-PLUS functions. We will describe the basic idea and the use of each clustering method, together with its graphical features. Each function is briefly illustrated with an example.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) products represent estimates of spatially distributed soil properties. These estimations comprise an element of uncertainty that is not evenly distributed over the area covered by DSM. If we quantify the uncertainty spatially explicit, this information can be used to improve the quality of DSM by optimizing the sampling design. This study follows a DSM approach using a Random Forest regression model, legacy soil samples, and terrain covariates to estimate topsoil silt and clay contents in a small catchment of 4.2 km2 in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, Central China. We aim (i) to introduce a method to derive spatial uncertainty, and (ii) to improve the initial DSM approaches by additional sampling that is guided by the spatial uncertainty. The proposed uncertainty measure is based on multiple realizations of individual and randomized decision tree models. We used the spatial uncertainty of the initial DSM approaches to stratify the study area and thereby to identify potential sampling areas of high uncertainties. Further, we tested how precisely available legacy samples cover the variability of the covariates within each potential sampling area to define the final sampling area and to apply a purposive sampling design. For the final Random Forest model calibration, we combined the legacy sample set with the additional samples. This uncertainty-driven DSM refinement was evaluated by comparing it to a second approach. In this second approach, the additional samples were replaced by a random sample set of the same size, obtained from the entire study area. For the comparative analysis, external, bootstrap-, and cross-validation was applied. The DSM approach using the uncertainty-driven refinement performed best. The averaged spatial uncertainty was reduced by 31\% for silt and by 27\% for clay compared to the initial DSM approach. Using external validation, the accuracy increased by the same proportions, while showing an overall accuracy of R2 = 0.59 for silt and R2 = 0.56 for clay.},

Aggregated soil series information in soil survey map units can be disaggregated by following a possibilistic decision tree approach to provide maps at the soil series level. The “overall map unit composition percentage” available in the soil survey tabular data can be treated as a possibility distribution of the prevalence of different soil series within all occurrences of the map unit in the survey area. A case study was conducted in Monroe County in southeastern Ohio. Three different learning approaches including C4.5 decision trees, nonspecificity based possibilistic decision trees and clustering based possibilistic decision trees were applied to the existent County survey, and the efficiency of predicting soils at the series level was assessed using an independent soil series point data set. The results showed an improvement in prediction accuracy by following the clustered possibilistic decision tree approach. The maps were useful in identifying the locations of component soil series within map unit associations, consociations, and complexes. Data mining from existent soil survey maps using the component information available in the tabular data can serve as a guide for disaggregating soil map units to create soil series maps, identifying misplacement of polygon boundaries, identifying presence of inclusions, and correcting mislabeled polygons, when updating soil surveys.},

  abstract = {We present a simple and fast mesh denoising method, which can remove noise effectively, while preserving mesh features such as sharp edges and corners. The method consists of two stages. Firstly, noisy face normals are filtered iteratively by weighted averaging of neighboring face normals. Secondly, vertex positions are iteratively updated to agree with the denoised face normals. The weight function used during normal filtering is much simpler than that used in previous similar approaches, being simply a trimmed quadratic. This makes the algorithm both fast and simple to implement. Vertex position updating is based on the integration of surface normals using a least-squares error criterion. Like previous algorithms, we solve the least-squares problem by gradient descent, but whereas previous methods needed user input to determine the iteration step size, we determine it automatically. In addition, we prove the convergence of the vertex position updating approach. Analysis and experiments show the advantages of our proposed method over various earlier surface denoising methods.},

  abstract = {Based on legacy soil data from a soil survey conducted recently in the traditional manner in Hong Kong of China, a digital soil mapping method was applied to produce soil order information for mountain areas of Hong Kong. Two modeling methods (decision tree analysis and linear discriminant analysis) were used, and their applications were compared. Much more effort was put on selecting soil covariates for modeling. First, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the variance of terrain attributes between soil orders. Then, a stepwise procedure was used to select soil covariates for linear discriminant analysis, and a backward removing procedure was developed to select soil covariates for tree modeling. At the same time, ANOVA results, as well as our knowledge and experience on soil mapping, were also taken into account for selecting soil covariates for tree modeling. Two linear discriminant models and four tree models were established finally, and their prediction performances were validated using a multiple jackknifing approach. Results showed that the discriminant model built on ANOVA results performed best, followed by the discriminant model built by stepwise, the tree model built by the backward removing procedure, the tree model built according to knowledge and experience on soil mapping, and the tree model built automatically. The results highlighted the importance of selecting soil covariates in modeling for soil mapping, and suggested the usefulness of methods used in this study for selecting soil covariates. The best discriminant model was finally selected to map soil orders for this area, and validation results showed that thus produced soil order map had a high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades extensive work has been done on sampling optimization. Many of the related papers focused on the optimization of sampling for only one soil property. However, there is a necessity to prepare a sampling strategy which is optimized for multivariate digital soil mapping (DSM) purposes. The aim of our work was to elaborate a sampling optimization methodology for multivariate DSM considering the demands on economic efficiency. We presented and tested it through a real-time survey at Tokaj Wine Region, Hungary. The soil properties of interest were pH, soil organic matter (SOM), and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content. The endusers defined the minimal requested precision for the DSM products (in terms of the average range of the 90\% prediction interval), and priority areas on which more detailed survey was requested. We planned a two-phase soil survey based on regression kriging (RK). The results from the first-phase sampling were used to parameterize the second-phase sampling in which spatial simulated annealing (SSA) was applied. The spatially averaged range of the 90\% prediction interval was the pre-survey quality measure which can be readily derived from the RK variance. The workflow can be summarized as follows: (1) rank the soil properties considering their spatial variabilities, and precision requests, (2) optimize the sampling design by SSA for the dominant soil property, (3) optimize the sampling by the invers application of SSA for the next soil property using the optimized design from the previous step, and (4) repeat the previous step until all soil property are being selected. In our case, SOM was the dominant property. According to the plot of the sample size vs. quality measure, the optimized design with 500 samples will ensure the minimal requested precision for the SOM map (i.e. 0.5\%). In the next step, the optimal removal of those sampling points was targeted which have less information content. In the cases of pH and CaCO3, 100 and 175 could be removed from the 500 samples, and the remaining 400 and 325 samples will ensure the requested precision for the pH (i.e. 1.2) and CaCO3 (i.e. 5\%) maps. We computed the relative sampling density on priority and non-priority areas for each sampling designs which showed that densities on priority areas were at least 1.5 times higher than on non-priority areas. We could conclude that the methodology is able to optimize the sampling design for multivariate DSM purposes considering numerous sampling constraints such as the predefined precision, priority areas, and economic efficiency.},

  abstract = {Two corresponding issues concerning Digital Soil Mapping are the demand for up-to-date, fine resolution soil data and the need to determine soil–landscape relationships. In this study, we propose a Bayesian Network framework as a suitable modelling approach to fulfil these requirements. Bayesian Networks are graphical probabilistic models in which predictions are obtained using prior probabilities derived from either measured data or expert opinion. They represent cause and effect relationships through connections in a network system. The advantage of the Bayesian Networks approach is that the models are easy to interpret and the uncertainty inherent in the relationships between variables can be expressed in terms of probability. In this study we will define the fundamentals of a Bayesian Network and the probability theory that underpins predictions. Then, using case studies, we demonstrate how they can be applied to predict soil properties (bulk density) and soil taxonomic class (associations).},

  abstract = {In response to the demand for soil spatial information and in order to improve natural resource management outcomes through the development of soil suitability maps, the acquisition of digital auxiliary data and matching it to soil data is increasing. With the harmonization of these data sets, through computer based methods, so-called Digital soil Maps (DSM) are increasingly being found to be as reliable as traditional soil mapping but without the prohibitive costs. In this paper, we attempt to develop a decision tree model for spatial prediction of soil classes (sub-great group taxa) in an area located in central of Iran, covering 780 km2. Using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, 186 soil profiles were selected and then allocated in two taxonomic orders: Aridisols and Entisols. Environmental predictors used in this study to represent soil forming factors were terrain attributes, ETM+ image and some existing categorical maps. Results showed that some covariates had more significant effect on the prediction of soil classes including topographic wetness index, MRVBF, NDVI, geomorphology maps. Furthermore, the results indicated that decision trees can predict spatial prediction of soil map units with reasonable accuracy (65\%).},

In this area, using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, 217 soil profiles were selected, sampled, analysed and allocated to taxonomic classes according to Soil Taxonomy up to family level. To test the user accuracy (UA) we established a calibration and validation set (70:30\%). Of the 5 soil family classes we map, the highest overall accuracy (0.71) and kappa index (0.69) are achieved using the DTA and ANN method. More specifically, the UA of prediction was up to 18.33\% better in comparison to LR. Moreover, our results showed that no improvement was obtained in prediction accuracy of DTA algorithm with minimizing taxonomic distance compared to minimizing misclassification error (0.71). Overall, our results suggest that the developed methodology could be used to predict soil classes in the other regions of Iran.},

  abstract = {Digital soil maps can be used to depict the ability of soil to fulfill certain functions. Digital maps offer reliable information that can be used in spatial planning programs. Several broad types of data mining approaches through Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) have been tested. The usual approach is to select a model that produces the best validation statistics. However, instead of choosing the best model, it is possible to combine all models realizing their strengths and weaknesses. We applied seven different techniques for the prediction of soil classes based on 194 sites located in Isfahan region. The mapping exercise aims to produce a soil class map that can be used for better understanding and management of soil resources. The models used in this study include Multinomial Logistic Regression (MnLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Networks (BN), and Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression (SMnLR). Two ensemble models based on majority votes (Ensemble.1) and MnLR (Ensemble.2) were implemented for integrating the optimal aspects of the individual techniques. The overall accuracy (OA), Cohen's kappa coefficient index (κ) and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated based on 10-fold-cross validation with 100 repeats at four soil taxonomic levels. The Ensemble.2 model was able to achieve larger OA, κ coefficient and AUC compared to the best performing individual model (i.e., RF). Results of the ensemble model showed a decreasing trend in OA from Order (0.90) to Subgroup (0.53). This was also the case for the κ statistic, which was the largest for the Order (0.66) and smallest for the Subgroup (0.43). Same decrease was observed for AUC from Order (0.81) to Subgroup (0.67). The improvement in κ was substantial (43 to 60\%) at all soil taxonomic levels, except the Order level. We conclude that the application of the ensemble model using the MnLR was optimal, as it provided a highly accurate prediction for all soil taxonomic levels over and above the individual models. It also used information from all models, and thus this method can be recommended for improved soil class modelling. Soil maps created by this DSM approach showed soils that are prone to degradation and need to be carefully managed and conserved to avoid further land degradation.},

  abstract = {Most common machine learning (ML) algorithms usually work well on balanced training sets, that is, datasets in which all classes are approximately represented equally. Otherwise, the accuracy estimates may be unreliable and classes with only a few values are often misclassified or neglected. This is known as a class imbalance problem in machine learning and datasets that do not meet this criterion are referred to as imbalanced data. Most datasets of soil classes are, therefore, imbalanced data. One of our main objectives is to compare eight resampling strategies that have been developed to counteract the imbalanced data problem. We compared the performance of five of the most common ML algorithms with the resampling approaches. The highest increase in prediction accuracy was achieved with SMOTE (the synthetic minority oversampling technique). In comparison to the baseline prediction on the original dataset, we achieved an increase of about 10, 20 and 10\% in the overall accuracy, kappa index and F-score, respectively. Regarding the ML approaches, random forest (RF) showed the best performance with an overall accuracy, kappa index and F-score of 66, 60 and 57\%, respectively. Moreover, the combination of RF and SMOTE improved the accuracy of the individual soil classes, compared to RF trained on the original dataset and allowed better prediction of soil classes with a low number of samples in the corresponding soil profile database, in our case for Chernozems. Our results show that balancing existing soil legacy data using synthetic sampling strategies can significantly improve the prediction accuracy in digital soil mapping (DSM).},

In northern New South Wales (NSW), where irrigated-cotton production is a dominant agricultural commodity, salinity even though is not currently such a serious problem, could pose a potential threat to cotton production. This chapter explores the use of discriminant analysis (DA) and other alternative models for using ancillary data to create threshold-based risk maps (rather than continuous maps) of soil salinity and compares these maps with more traditional indicator predictions. The opportunity for incorporating an error analysis into DA is also explored. The hypothesis for including the error analysis in DA and related models is that a certain level of information remains in the residuals of the initial model and that this information could be extracted and analysed to improve the final prediction. The ancillary-based models used in this chapter did not produce better predictions than a Multi-Indicator Kriging (MIK) approach that did not include the ancillary data. The DA models produced better prediction than the Multi-Variate Stepwise Linear Regression with the Kriging (MSLR-K) and Binomial Linear Regression models. A benefit of the DA approaches is the generation of probability maps, similar to MIK, that may be used in future decision making.},

  abstract = {Digital soil modelling and mapping is reliant on the availability and utility of easily derived and accessible covariates. In this paper, the value of covariates derived from a time-series of remotely-sensed ASTER satellite imagery and digital elevation models were evaluated for modelling two soil attributes — soil depth and watertable depth. Modelling was performed at two resolutions: a fine resolution (15 m pixels) that relates to the resolution of the ASTER Visible-NIR bands, and a larger resolution (90 m pixels) that relates to the resolution of the thermal bands of the ASTER imagery. Upscaling to a larger pixel size and downscaling to a smaller pixel size were performed to adjust the covariates where necessary. A regression tree approach was used to model soil depth and watertable depth, recorded as a binary ‘deep’ or ‘shallow’ response, using the ASTER imagery-derived covariates and digital terrain attributes (DTAs). Modelling was performed at a single spatial resolution (15 or 90 m pixels) using the imagery-derived covariates only, the DTAs only, or a mixture of both. A multi-resolution model was also generated, by using both imagery-derived covariates and DTAs at both resolutions. When mixed with the DTAs, the imagery-derived covariates helped explain the uncertainty (variance) in the soil depth data but not in the watertable depth. The ASTER-derived downscaled evapotranspiration-based covariates were of particular significance in the soil depth modelling. Watertable depth was best explained by models that used DTAs at a smaller pixel size. Information on vegetative growth was neither superior nor complementary to information on terrain for modelling watertable depth. Using a multi-resolution model significantly improved the modelling of soil depth but not of watertable depth. The effect of covariate and modelling resolution on model performance is discussed within the context of the GlobalSoilMap.net project.},

  abstract = {As agricultural data and information becomes more abundant, diagnostics are needed to quickly and efficiently interrogate these data. Indices exist to identify sensor data with structured spatial variation, conducive to site-specific management. However, these indices do not indicate if this spatial variation is driven by managerial or environmental effects. A new index is proposed to identify perennial (or ordered row) fields that are likely or highly likely to have management effects within the spatial pattern of sensor data. This is determined by investigating differences in anisotropic (directional) variograms parallel and perpendicular to the direction of management (row orientation). Small differences are indicative of isotropic (environmental-driven) variation. Large differences indicate row and management effects. The index is derived, run on a database of 1080 simulated fields and applied to yield data from 124 vineyard blocks to assess index performance and response to different levels of variation. Simulations showed that the index is non-responsive to the magnitude of variation but responds strongly to anisotropy in the data. The stochastic variance in the data was observed to have an effect on index response and may be problematic when applied to noisy data sets. The index scores for the simulated and real-world data showed a similar pattern of response and the index was able to identify vineyard blocks where differential row management had generated differing yield responses. The index scores are continuous and some general guidelines for use of the index are proposed.},

  abstract = {Soils and landscapes evolve in tandem. Landscape position is a strong determinant of vertical soil development, which has often been formalized in the catena concept. At the same time, soil properties are strong determinants of geomorphic processes such as overland erosion, landsliding and creep. We present a new soilscape evolution model; LORICA, to study these numerous interactions between soil and landscape development. The model is based on the existing landscape evolution model LAPSUS and the soil formation model MILESD. The model includes similar soil formation processes as MILESD, but the main novelties include the consideration of more layers and the dynamic adaption of the number of layers as a function of the soil profile's heterogeneity. New processes in the landscape evolution component include a negative feedback of vegetation and armouring and particle size selectivity of the erosion–deposition process. In order to quantify these different interactions, we present a full sensitivity analysis of the input parameters. First results show that the model successfully simulates various soil–landscape interactions, leading to outputs where the surface changes in the landscape clearly depend on soil development, and soil changes depend on landscape location. Sensitivity analysis of the model confirms that soil and landscape interact: variables controlling amount and position of fine clay have the largest effect on erosion, and erosion variables control among others the amount of chemical weathering. These results show the importance of particle size distribution, and especially processes controlling the presence of finer clay particles that are easily eroded, both for the resulting landscape form as for the resulting soil profiles. Further research will have to show whether this is specific to the boundary conditions of this study or a general phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Traditional soil maps have helped us to better understand soil, to form our concepts and to teach and transfer our ideas about it, and so they have been used for many purposes. Although, soil maps are available in many countries, there is a need for them to be updated because they are often deficient in that their spatial delineations and their descriptions are subjective and lack assessments of uncertainty. Updating them is a priority for federal soil surveys worldwide as well as for research, teaching and communication. New data from sensors and quantitative ‘digital’ methods provide us with the tools to do so. Here, we present an approach to update large scale, national soil maps with data derived from a combination of traditional soil profile classifications, classifications made with visible–near infrared (vis–NIR) spectroscopy, and digital soil class mapping (DSM). Our results present an update of the Australian Soil Classification (ASC) orders map. The overall error rate of the DSM model, tested on an independent validation set, was 55.6\%, and a few of the orders were poorly classified. We discuss the possible reasons for these errors, but argue that compared to the previous ASC maps, our classification was derived objectively, using currently best available data sets and methods, the classification model was interpretable in terms of the factors of soil formation, the modelling produced a 1 × 1 km resolution soil map with estimates of spatial uncertainty for each soil order and our map has no artefacts at state and territory borders.},

The best known thematic map type is the choropleth, in which regions are colored according to the distribution of a data variable.

Thematic maps are created by stacking layers, where per layer, data can be mapped to one or more aesthetics. It is also possible to generate small multiples. Thematic maps can be further embellished by configuring the map layout and by adding map attributes, such as a scale bar and a compass. Besides plotting thematic maps on the graphics device, they can also be made interactive as an HTML widget. In addition, the R package tmaptools contains several convenient functions for reading and processing spatial data.},

Recent improvements in the availability of detailed digital soils data, as well as computing capacity to handle large spatial data sets and statistical approaches to incorporate existing data in various formats, provide an opportunity to develop more detailed and accurate estimates of soil properties. Our objective is to improve the accuracy and precision of regional and national soil property estimates using spatial disaggregation techniques that combine detailed soil class maps with spatial data on environmental covariates such as topography and geology to discern the spatial distribution, variability, and extent of component soils--and the associated soil properties--within soil map units. A regional approach is employed based on recognized major land resource areas (MLRA), which are expected to have relatively consistent soil-landscape relationships. Two map units of large extent in the southern portion of the Eastern Allegheny Plateau and Mountains (MLRA 127) provide an illustration of the disaggregation approach to produce raster-based, landscape-scale maps of SOC. The disaggregated data identifies locations of component soils within soil class map units, depicting the spatial distribution of soils with higher and lower SOC stocks instead of using an average SOC value for the entire extent of a soil map unit. For this example, the disaggregated data predicted 6\% higher average SOC content compared to the published soil class map data.},

These current approaches provide the information needed for forest ecosystem management but constrain the thematic and spatial resolution of mapping and are infrequently repeated. The goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of an unsupervised, quantitative technique based on Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and multi-spectral satellite imagery for mapping local-scale ecosystems over a heterogeneous landscape of forested and non-forested ecosystems. We derived a range of metrics characterizing local terrain and vegetation from LiDAR and RapidEye imagery for Calvert and Hecate Islands, British Columbia. These metrics were used in a cluster analysis to classify and quantitatively characterize ecological units across the island. A total of 18 clusters were derived. The clusters were attributed with quantitative summary statistics from the remotely sensed data inputs and contextualized through comparison to ecological units delineated in a traditional expert-driven mapping method using aerial photographs. The 18 clusters describe ecosystems ranging from open shrublands to dense, productive forest and include a riparian zone and many wetter and wetland ecosystems. The clusters provide detailed, spatially-explicit information for characterizing the landscape as a mosaic of units defined by topography and vegetation structure. This study demonstrates that using various types of remotely sensed data in a quantitative classification can provide scientists and managers with multivariate information unique from that which results from traditional, expert-based ecosystem mapping methods.},

In a short time, high resolution data dedicated to the assessment of the vine characteristics, the soil, the harvest, etc. will become a reality. This information sources will allow the wine grower to have a spatial accurate knowledge of the vineyard and its variability. Such an accuracy in monitoring the production system was never achieved until now.

This work makes also an overview of the main references in vineyard variability. It presents the main results observed on yield, sugar, TTA, etc. within field variability. For each of these parameters clues on magnitude of variation and coefficient of variation observed at a within field scale are given.},

Our method provides a Technical Opportunity index (TOi). The novelty of this approach is to process yield data (or other within-field sources of information) with a mathematical morphological filter based on erosions and dilations. This filter enables us to take into account how the machine operates in the field and especially the minimum area (kernel) within which it can operate reliably. Tests on theoretical fields obtained by a simulated annealing procedure and on a real vineyard showed that the TOi was appropriate for assessing whether the spatial variation in a field was technically manageable.},

  abstract = {Spatial analyses of cropland productivity levels and land use data from 2000 and 2006 were performed to assess the loss of cropland resources for biomass production of the European Union due to land take. Productivity loss in administrative regions was calculated on the basis of the extent and quality of agricultural land resources converted to artificial surfaces. Data show that while all EU member states experience constant decrease of their production capacity, there are also considerable differences among countries and regions. Based on the analysis of 24 member states, the EU lost 0.27\% of its cropland and 0.26\% of its crop productive potential in the period between 2000 and 2006 due to land take. The loss of agricultural land during the study period was the highest in the Netherlands, which lost 1.57\% of its crop production potential within six years. The figures are quite alarming for Cyprus (0.84\%), Ireland (0.77\%) and Spain (0.49\%) as well. In metropolitan areas of Barcelona, Berlin, Bratislava, Bucharest, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Milan, and Vienna infrastructural investment occurred on the higher quality cropland while Budapest, Paris, and Warsaw spread their urban growth to areas of less productive cropland. Denmark had to face the largest loss of its food production capacity for each citizen, exceeding the equivalent of 4 kg capita−1 year−1 of wheat, followed by Ireland with more than the equivalent of 3 kg wheat and Spain, Netherlands, Hungary, Cyprus and France all above 2 kg loss per capita, annually. The EU lost an amount of cropland production potential equal to approximately 700,000 t of wheat grain, annually, in the study period. Results highlight the following general trends: (i) land conversion from different land cover types to artificial surfaces follows the historic trends in Europe with continuing consumption of more productive areas from its land resources; (ii) the conversion rate of croplands to artificial surfaces is growing with increased population growth; (iii) with the growing rate of population increase, increasingly higher quality croplands are converted to artificial surfaces, while with faster rates of population decline increasingly poorer quality croplands are converted; (iv) countries with more developed economies generally convert cropland at a higher speed; and (v) there is a negative correlation between annual economic growth and the rate of cropland conversion.},

Previous work has hinted at the improvement in prediction accuracy attributed to clustering algorithms if used to pre-process the data. In this work we more deeply investigate the direct utility of using clustering to improve prediction accuracy and provide explanations for why this may be so. We look at a number of datasets, run k-means at different scales and for each scale we train predictors. This produces k sets of predictions. These predictions are then combined by a naïve ensemble. We observed that this use of a predictor in conjunction with clustering improved the prediction accuracy in most datasets. We believe this indicates the predictive utility of exploiting structure in the data and the data compression handed over by clustering. We also found that using this method improves upon the prediction of even a Random Forests predictor which suggests this method is providing a novel, and useful source of variance in the prediction process.},

  abstract = {Partial cloud cover is a severe problem in the optical remote sensing images. The problem can be mostly overcome by mosaicking the cloud-free areas of the multi-temporal images. In this paper, multidisciplinary methods are proposed to generate cloud-free mosaic images from multi-temporal SPOT images in three steps. At first, the original images are enhanced in both brightness and chromaticity. Secondly, the linear spectral unmixing method (LSU) is used to extract all cloud cover regions. Then, we choose the base image that has the least thin-cloud cover and divide the base image into grid zones. We find the thin-cloud and cloud-shadow zones in the eight neighbors of the thick-cloud zones based on the relative locations and the sun elevation angle. At last, the cloud and cloudshadow zones of the base image are replaced by the same-location cloud-free zones on other images. Between each two zones of the base image and the replacing image, we create a transition zone. The multiscale wavelet-based fusion method is then used to fuse the pixels in the zones to generate cloud-free satellite images. Based on our complete and sophisticated approach, the high-quality fused results are produced from the source images that have variant brightness.},

  abstract = {Crop production in West Africa is largely under rainfed conditions, making the system vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. However, the impact of future climate on the geographic range of many crops in West Africa is still uncertain. This is exacerbated by considerable uncertainty in projecting future West African climate by global circulation models (GCMs). In this paper, the current land suitability for rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) production in West Africa and how it would change in response to a range of future climate changes were assessed. A novel non-additive approach involving the integration of a fuzzy measure modelling procedure and the Choquet integral to deal with non-linear relationships among criteria was introduced. The supervised and unsupervised variants of the approach and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregators were evaluated and compared using data on the current climate, soil characteristics, and actual maize yield estimates at some locations across the region. The supervised fuzzy measure modelling outperformed the unsupervised variant and the OWA operators, demonstrating the importance of considering interaction among criteria and incorporating human reasoning in multicriteria analysis. Consequently, the supervised modelling approach was used to estimate suitability scores for rainfed maize for the current and a range of plausible future climates which were generated from unique combinations of temperature and rainfall percentile values (5th, 50th and 95th) from 25 and 32 GCMs projections under the RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Under the current climate in West Africa, the combined suitable/highly suitable areas for rainfed maize production are in the humid savanna zones. In contrast, the forest region to the south exhibited moderate suitability with the semi-arid savanna zones being marginally suitable. Relative to the current climate in which 91.3\% of West Africa is at least moderately suitable for maize production, suitability for maize will change in at least 43\% of West Africa in response to future climate change. Across all scenarios and years, future suitability in the semi-arid region of the SudanoSahelian savannas shows strong sensitivity to uncertainty in rainfall projections. However, regardless of the trajectory of future rainfall projection, the 95th percentile temperature projection will decrease suitability in about 15\% of the West African region by 2080 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Because of the incorporation of uncertainties of future climate projections in this analysis, the results from this study can be used in the development of flexible climate adaptation strategies.},

The aim of this work was to evaluate whether early grape sampling is a relevant tool for within-vineyard zone definition. The study was carried out in 2010 and 2011 in a 4.2 ha vineyard, where a grid of 60 sampling points was defined. 300-berry samples were picked from each sampling point after veraison and at harvest, post-veraison information being used to define zones within the vineyard after fuzzy k-means analysis and subsequent application of a zoning procedure that took into account membership degree and neighbourhood criteria. Two variations of the zoning procedure were used, standard (StdZ) and top (TopZ) zoning. Each was designed to meet different requirements of wineries; StdZ gave the same oenological relevance to all the zones, and TopZ differentiated the zones producing ‘‘top class’’ grapes, minimizing the within-zone variability in the top-class zone. Grape composition obtained at harvest from the zones delineated post-veraison was compared. Zone delineation using post-veraison data was proved to be oenologically relevant, provided sampling is performed once veraison is completed. The two zoning algorithms designed were shown to be suitable for objective zone delineation according to the goals intended for each.},

  abstract = {In this paper results from the evaluation of several state-of-the-art pansharpening techniques are presented for the VNIR and SWIR bands of Sentinel-2. A procedure for the pansharpening is also proposed which aims at respecting the closest spectral similarities between the higher and lower resolution bands. The evaluation included 21 different fusion algorithms and three evaluation frameworks based both on standard quantitative image similarity indexes and qualitative evaluation from remote sensing experts. The overall analysis of the evaluation results indicated that remote sensing experts disagreed with the outcomes and method ranking from the quantitative assessment. The employed image quality similarity indexes and quantitative evaluation framework based on both high and reduced resolution data from the literature didn’t manage to highlight/evaluate mainly the spatial information that was injected to the lower resolution images. Regarding the SWIR bands none of the methods managed to deliver significantly better results than a standard bicubic interpolation on the original low resolution bands.},

Merlot, Cabernet franc, and Cabernet Sauvignon were compared on a gravelly soil, a soil with a heavy clay subsoil, and a sandy soil with a water table within the
reach of the roots. The influence of climate was assessed with year-to-year variations of maximum and minimum temperatures, degree days (base of 10°C), sunshine hours, ET o , rainfall, and water balance for the period 1996 to
2000. The effects of climate, soil, and cultivar were found to be highly significant with regard to vine behavior and berry composition (an example being anthocyanin concentration). The impacts of climate and soil were greater
than that of cultivar. Many of the variables correlated with the intensity of vine water stress. It is likely that the
effects of climate and soil on fruit quality are mediated through their influence on vine water status.},

  abstract = {A “terroir” is a cultivated ecosystem in which the vine interacts with the soil and the climate. The soil influences vine development and grape ripening through soil temperature, water supply and mineral supply. Soil temperature has a significant effect on vine phenology. Limited water supply to the vines restricts shoot and berry growth, which is critical for reaching a suitable grape composition to produce high-quality red wines. Secondary metabolites, like polyphenols (anthocyanins, tannins) and aroma compounds or their precursors, are impacted in particular by vine water status. Among nutrients vines pick up from the soil, nitrogen plays a key role. Nitrogen influences vine vigor, yield, berry size and grape composition. Low nitrogen supply stimulates the synthesis of polyphenols, while it can negatively impact certain aroma compounds in grapes and wines, like volatile thiols. Over the past decades, tools have been developed to quantify terroir parameters. Vine water status can be assessed by means of carbon isotope discrimination measured on grape sugar (so-called δ13C). Vine nitrogen status can be assessed with the measurement of Yeast Available Nitrogen (YAN) in grape must. In this way, terroir parameters can not only be measured but also mapped. Ideally, vineyards should be established in areas where soil temperature (relative to air temperature), soil water holding capacity (relative to rainfall and potential evapotranspiration) and soil nitrogen availability are optimum for the type of wine which is intended to be produced. Terroir expression can, however, be optimized by choosing appropriate plant material, and via vineyard floor management, fertilization and other management techniques.},

  abstract = {This study presents an application of a multiple point geostatistics (MPS) to map landforms. MPS uses information at multiple cell locations including morphometric attributes at a target mapping cell, i.e. digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives, and non-morphometric attributes, i.e. landforms at the neighboring cells, to determine the landform. The technique requires a training data set, consisting of a field map of landforms and a DEM. Mapping landforms proceeds in two main steps. First, the number of cells per landform class, associated with a set of observed attributes discretized into classes (e.g. slope class), is retrieved from the training image and stored in a frequency tree, which is a hierarchical database. Second, the algorithm visits the non-mapped cells and assigns to these a realization of a landform class, based on the probability function of landforms conditioned to the observed attributes as retrieved from the frequency tree. The approach was tested using a data set for the Buëch catchment in the French Alps. We used four morphometric attributes extracted from a 37.5-m resolution DEM as well as two non-morphometric attributes observed in the neighborhood. The training data set was taken from multiple locations, covering 10\% of the total area. The mapping was performed in a stochastic framework, in which 35 map realizations were generated and used to derive the probabilistic map of landforms. Based on this configuration, the technique yielded a map with 51.2\% of correct cells, evaluated against the field map of landforms. The mapping accuracy is relatively high at high elevations, compared to the mid-slope and low-lying areas. Debris slope was mapped with the highest accuracy, while MPS shows a low capability in mapping hogback and glacis. The mapping accuracy is highest for training areas with a size of 7.5–10\% of the total area. Reducing the size of the training images resulted in a decreased mapping quality, as the frequency database only represents local characteristics of landforms that are not representative for the remaining area. MPS outperforms a rulebased technique that only uses the morphometric attributes at the target mapping cell in the classification (i.e. one-point statistics technique), by 15\% of cell accuracy.},

  abstract = {Soil maps’ value is increasingly recognised for enabling the optimal management of ecosystems. Digital soil mapping (DSM) can overcome the cost constraints of traditional mapping methods, but requires local area-specific research. As South Africa is blessed with the land type survey, local DSM research should start with the disaggregation of this resource. This paper shows how two land types (Ea34 and Ca11) near Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal were disaggregated using DSM methods. A series of soil maps were created. With each map, more information was incorporated when creating the map. For Map 1 only the land type inventory and terrain analysis were used. A reconnaissance field visit with the land type surveyor was added for the second map. Field work and a simplified soil association legend improved the map accuracy for Maps 3 and 4, which were created using 30\% and 60\%, respectively, of the observation points as training data. The accuracy of the maps increased when more information was utilised. Map 1 reached an accuracy of 35\%, whereas Map 4 achieved a commendable accuracy of 67\%. Thus DSM methods can be used to disaggregate land types into accurate soil association maps. Emerging principles include that lithology rather than hard geology should be used as parent material input, field work is critical to obtain acceptable results, and simplifying the map legend into soil associations improves the accuracy of the map.},

  abstract = {Soil spatial information is increasingly sought after for various agricultural, environmental and developmental uses, but is often unavailable, also in southern Africa. Digital soil mapping (DSM) can provide the tools to fill this gap, but the uptake in developing countries have been slow. Local research is required to adapt internationally developed methodologies to unique local situations. In southern Africa DSM research have reached the level where DSM tools can now be used in commercial soil related projects. Several DSM case studies, conducted across Southern Africa, have provided the platform from which this work is presented. These case studies were done for a range of situations, including environmental settings with variations, size, data availability and aim of the soil map. Three different approaches have been identified as useful DSM tools, with varying costs and level of information it provides. Land type disaggregation is the cheapest, as it is largely desktop based, but can only produce small scale soil association maps. The expert knowledge approach is the most widely used commercially. Large scale soil associations can be mapped, and 30 soil observations per homogeneous soil distribution area are required. Machine learning methods can map soil properties, but rely on large data sources, consequently it is the costliest. Machine learning is therefore used to produce large scale maps large areas, where cost can be diluted. This paper gives an outline of DSM research in southern Africa and presents a case study of each of the DSM approaches, showing the methodology, potential and limitations of the approach within a commercial context. Specific case studies presented in this paper include the agricultural assessment of 166 km of pipeline for a water distribution project in Limpopo (land type disaggregation), a land capability assessment of a 15,000 ha open coal mining area in Mozambique (expert knowledge) and hydropedological mapping in Johannesburg (machine learning).},

  abstract = {Urban sprawl and the accompanying development is set to increase pressure on the hydrological system. In turn, the hydrology of an area affects the infrastructure. Hydropedology, can assist to sustainably manage the infrastructure-hydrology interaction. Even though the hillslope scale is accepted as ideal for hydropedological assessments, regional soil maps have been used when hydropedology assessments were undertaken for larger areas. This study uses a hillslope based approach within a digital soil mapping method to conduct a hydropedological assessment for a large (12,000 ha) urban area under developmental pressure within Johannesburg, South Africa. One hundred and thirty-three hillslopes within the study area were delineated and mean and standard deviation of terrain attributes were calculated for each hillslope. Based on these values, the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) method was used to select 30 hillslopes on which soil observations would be made, in a transect, at the surveyor's discretion. A hydropedological soil map was created with the multinomial logistic regression algorithm and the 142 soil observations made. The soil map attained an acceptable 69\% validation point accuracy and a Kappa value of 0.59, and was used to create a hillslope conceptual hydrological response map. The chi-square test and QQ-plots indicated that the cLHS selected hillslopes represented the hillslopes of the study site well, but the observations only represented some of the terrain attributes well. Despite the range of the observation dataset covering at least 98.7\% of the pixels for the multi resolution index of valley bottom flatness (MRVBF), topographic wetness index (TWI) and altitude above channel network layers, their site distribution differed statistically from that of the observation distribution. The hillslope based survey approach allowed for an acceptable soil map to be created, while allowing for hillslope based hydropedological interpretations to be made. The “cost” for the hillslope based approach was that the distribution of some covariates for the observations differed from their distributions over the entire site.},

  abstract = {Urbanization and hydrology have an interactive relationship, as urbanization changing the hydrology of a system and the hydrology commonly causing structural damage to the infrastructure. Hydrological modelling has been used to quantify the water causing structural impacts, and to provide solutions to the issues. However, in already‐urbanized areas, creating a soil map to use as input in the modelling process is difficult, as observation positions are limited and visuals of the natural vegetation which indicate soil distribution are unnatural. This project used historical satellite images in combination with terrain parameters and digital soil mapping methods to produce an accurate (Kappa statistic = 0.81) hydropedology soil map for the Cosmo City suburb in Johannesburg, South Africa. The map was used as input into the HYDRUS 2D and SWAT hydrological models to quantify the water creating road damage at Kampala Crescent, a road within Cosmo City (using HYDRUS 2D), as well as the impact of urbanization on the hydrology of the area (using SWAT). HYDRUS 2D modelling showed that a subsurface drain installed at Kampala Crescent would need a carrying capacity of 0.3 m3.h−1.m−1 to alleviate the road damage, while SWAT modelling shows that surface runoff in Cosmo City will commence with as little rainfall as 2 mm.month−1. This project showcases the value of multidisciplinary work. The remote sensing was invaluable to the mapping, which informed the hydrological modelling and subsequently provided answers to the engineers, who could then mitigate the hydrology‐related issues within Cosmo City.},

This study merges laboratory, field and remote sensing data to create digital maps of soil suborders based on the Brazilian Soil Classification System, with and without additional textural classification, in an area of 13 000 ha in the state of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Data from 289 visited soil profiles were used in multinomial logistic regression to predict soil suborders from geospatial data (geology, topography, emissivity and vegetation index) and visible–near infrared (400–2500 nm) reflectance of soil samples collected at three depths (0–20, 40–60 and 80–100 cm). The derived maps were validated with 47 external observations, and compared with two conventional soil maps at scales of 1:100 000 and 1:20 000. Soil suborders with and without textural classification were predicted correctly for 44 and 52\% of the soil profiles, respectively. The derived suborder maps agreed with the 1:100 000 and 1:20 000 conventional maps in 20 and 23\% (with textural classification) and 41 and 46\% (without textural classification) of the area, respectively. Soils that were well defined along relief gradients (Latosols and Argisols) were predicted with up to 91\% agreement, whereas soils in complex areas (Cambisols and Neosols) were poorly predicted. Adding textural classification to suborders considerably degraded classification accuracy; thus modelling at the suborder level alone is recommended. Stream density and laboratory soil reflectance improved all classification models, showing their potential to aid digital soil mapping in complex tropical environments.},

  abstract = {Given the forthcoming availability of Sentinel-2 (S2) images, this paper provides a systematic comparison of retrieval accuracy and processing speed of a multitude of parametric, non-parametric and physically-based retrieval methods using simulated S2 data. An experimental field dataset (SPARC), collected at the agricultural site of Barrax (Spain), was used to evaluate different retrieval methods on their ability to estimate leaf area index (LAI). With regard to parametric methods, all possible band combinations for several two-band and three-band index formulations and a linear regression fitting function have been evaluated. From a set of over ten thousand indices evaluated, the best performing one was an optimized three-band combination according to ðq560 À q1610 À q2190Þ=ðq560 þ q1610 þ q2190Þ with a 10-fold cross-validation RC2V of 0.82 (RMSECV : 0.62). This family of methods excel for their fast processing speed, e.g., 0.05 s to calibrate and validate the regression function, and 3.8 s to map a simulated S2 image. With regard to non-parametric methods, 11 machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs) have been evaluated. This methodological family has the advantage of making use of the full optical spectrum as well as flexible, nonlinear fitting. Particularly kernel-based MLRAs lead to excellent results, with variational heteroscedastic (VH) Gaussian Processes regression (GPR) as the best performing method, with a R2CV of 0.90 (RMSECV : 0.44). Additionally, the model is trained and validated relatively fast (1.70 s) and the processed image (taking 73.88 s) includes associated uncertainty estimates. More challenging is the inversion of a PROSAIL based radiative transfer model (RTM). After the generation of a look-up table (LUT), a multitude of cost functions and regularization options were evaluated. The best performing cost function is Pearson’s v-square. It led to a R2 of 0.74 (RMSE: 0.80) against the validation dataset. While its validation went fast (0.33 s), due to a per-pixel LUT solving using a cost function, image processing took considerably more time (01:01:47). Summarizing, when it comes to accurate and sufficiently fast processing of imagery to generate vegetation attributes, this paper concludes that the family of kernel-based MLRAs (e.g. GPR) is the most promising processing approach.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping is becoming a powerful tool to increase the spatial detail of soil information over large areas, which is essential to address agronomic and environmental issues. When it exists, information about soil is often sparse or available at a coarser resolution than required. The spatial distribution of soil at the regional scale is usually represented as a set of polygons defining Soil Map Units (SMUs), each including several Soil Type Units (STUs), which are not spatially delineated but semantically described in a database. Delineation of STUs within SMUs, i.e. spatial disaggregation of SMU, should improve the precision of soil information derived from legacy and ancillary data. The aim of this study was to predict STUs by spatially disaggregating SMUs through a decision-tree approach that considered expert knowledge about soil-landscape relationships embedded in soil databases. In a 27,376 km2 study area in north-western France (Brittany), 434 SMUs were delineated at 1:250,000 scale, and 320 STUs, their relative area in the SMUs, and their geomorphological and geological contexts were described. A calibration dataset of points was established using stratified random sampling (n = 352,188). To retrieve soil-landscape relationships, expert rules for soil distribution defined by soil surveyors and based on topography, parent material and waterlogging index were considered in order to allocate an STU to 83\% of the calibration dataset. The calibration dataset and covariates (i.e. pedological, geological and terrain attributes; land use; airborne gamma-ray spectrometry) were then used to build and extrapolate the decision tree using the C.5 algorithm in DSMART software. Several iterations were performed, providing a probability of occurrence of each possible STU within the study area. External validation was performed by comparing predictions of the disaggregation procedure to available soil maps at scales of 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 and observed profiles. Overall accuracies ranged from 41 to 72\%, depending on the validation method (per pixel vs. 3 × 3 windows of pixels, per STU vs. STU grouped by semantic proximity (n = 204)). Introducing expert rules based on soil-landscape relationships to allocate STUs to calibration samples enabled production of a soil map with clear spatial structures, yielding expected spatial patterns of soil organisation. Future work notably concerns estimating soil properties at multiple depths deriving from STU predictions, according to the GlobalSoilMap project.},

This result strengthens the relevance of the expert sampling procedure in soil prediction." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RL6JC2ZT?page=10}{Vincent et al 2018:139})

"This method has two major limitations: in the current version of DSMART used for this study, the sampling process does not consider the area of polygons, resulting in under-sampling of large polygons, and STU allocation does not consider soil-landscape relationships, since a given STU has the same probability of being predicted at any point in the SMU."

"Predicting soil properties from prior spatialized STUs, as done here, instead of predicting soil properties directly from point information about the target property, has two main benefits. It achieves i) consistency among soil properties for a given positioning, which is necessary because several soil properties are often required in models, and ii) vertical coherence among multiple soil horizons at each pixel. However the approach developed in this work has two main disadvantages: the prediction process is more challenging than predicting soil properties directly bymachine learning approaches form point information; and predicting STUs require having consistent information about soil organisation on the study area."

  abstract = {Last century, during the ‘Green Revolution’ the use of synthetic fertilizers contributed to increased agricultural production. However, their use did not reflect local soil and water conditions because recommendations were developed for larger agro-ecological zones. They only focused on increased productivity, neglecting any adverse environmental consequences. Largely, this legacy remains and recommendations are still made using ‘top-down’ procedures based on limited data and generic, empirical relations between soil nutrient contents, fertilization rates and yields. Using soil sensors in agriculture can fundamentally change this approach by allowing innovative ‘bottom-up’ approaches that characterize local soil and environmental conditions in space and time, improving the efficiency of production to maximize farm incomes and minimize environmental side effects. The sensed information can be used to build site-specific databases of relations between soil and plant condition and growth. Recent technological developments in sensing coupled with ongoing advances in information and communication technologies have given ground to a renewed interest in soil sensing and its use in different applications at different spatial scales. Soil sensing can facilitate the measurement and monitoring of the soil's physical and biochemical attributes (e.g. nutrients, water) to better understand their dynamics, their interactions with the environment while considering their large spatial heterogeneity. The new sensing methods can also be used to effectively monitor soil organic carbon and be central to the adoption of best agronomic practices that also allow carbon sequestration and a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, sensing can help us to better articulate the potential of soil to meet the world's needs for food, fiber, climate adaptation and environmental sustainability allowing the design and implementation of innovative management practices and policy aimed at sustainable development.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in on-the-go soil sensing, terrain modelling and yield mapping have made available large quantities of information about the within-field variability of soil and crop properties. But the selection of the key variables for an identification of management zones, required for precision agriculture, is not straightforward. To investigate a procedure for this selection, an 8 ha agricultural field in the Loess belt of Belgium was considered for this study. The available information consisted of: (i) top- and subsoil samples taken at 110 locations, on which soil properties: textural fractions, organic carbon (OC), CaCO3 and pH were analysed, (ii) soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) obtained through an electromagnetic induction based sensor, and (iii) wetness index, stream power index and steepest slope angle derived from a detailed digital elevation model (DEM). A principal component analysis, involving 12 soil and topographic properties and two ECa variables, identified three components explaining 67.4\% of the total variability. These three components were best represented by pH, ECa that strongly associated with texture and OC. However, OC was closely related to some more readily obtainable topographic properties, and therefore elevation was preferred. A fuzzy k-means classification of these three variables produced four potential management classes. Three-year average standardized yield maps of grain and straw showed productivity differences across these classes, but mainly linked to their landscape position. In the loess area with complex soil-landscape interactions pH, ECa and elevation can be considered as key properties to delineate potential management classes.},

  abstract = {With the advances of new proximal soil sensing technologies, soil properties can be inferred by a variety of sensors, each having its distinct level of accuracy. This measurement error affects subsequent modelling and therefore must be integrated when calibrating a spatial prediction model. This paper introduces a deep learning model for contextual digital soil mapping (DSM) using uncertain measurements of the soil property. The deep learning model, called the convolutional neural network (CNN), has the advantage that it uses as input a local representation of environmental covariates to leverage the spatial information contained in the vicinity of a location. Spatial non-linear relationships between measured soil properties and neighbouring covariate pixel values are found by optimizing an objective function, which can be weighted with respect to a measurement error of soil observations. In addition, a single model can be trained to predict a soil property at different soil depths. This method is tested in mapping top- and subsoil organic carbon using laboratory-analysed and spectroscopically inferred measurements. Results show that the CNN significantly increased prediction accuracy as indicated by the coefficient of determination and concordance correlation coefficient, when compared to a conventional DSM technique. Deeper soil layer prediction error decreased, while preserving the interrelation between soil property and depths. The tests conducted suggest that the CNN benefits from using local contextual information up to 260 to 360 m. We conclude that the CNN is a flexible, effective and promising model to predict soil properties at multiple depths while accounting for contextual covariate information and measurement error.},

  abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques are widely employed to generate soil e maps. Soil properties are typically predicted individually, while ignoring the interrelation between them. Models for predicting multiple properties exist, but they are computationally demanding and often fail to provide accurate description of the associated uncertainty. In this paper a convolutional neural network t (CNN) model is described to predict several soil properties with quantified uncertainty. CNN has the advantage that it incorporates spatial contextual information of environmental covariates surrounding an observation. A single CNN model can be trained to predict multiple soil properties simultaneously. I further propose a two-step approach to estimate the uncertainty of the prediction for p mapping using a neural network model. The methodology is tested mapping six soil properties on the French metropolitan territory using measurements from the LUCAS dataset and a large set of environmental covariates portraying the factors of soil formation. Results indicate that the multivariate CNN model e produces accurate maps as shown by the coefficient of determination and concordance correlation coefficient, compared to a conventional machine learning technique. For this country extent mapping, the maps predicted by CNN have a detailed pattern with significant spatial variation. Evaluation of the uncerctainty maps using the median of the standardized squared prediction error and accuracy plots suggests that the uncertainty was accurately quantified, albeit slightly underestimated. The tests conducted using different window size of input covariates to predict the soil properties indicate that CNN benefits from using local contextual information in a radius of 4.5 km. I conclude that CNN cis an effective model to predict several soil properties and that the associated uncertainty can be accurately quantified with the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {The uptake of machine learning (ML) algorithms in digital soil mapping (DSM) is transforming the way soil scientists produce their maps. Machine learning is currently applied to mapping soil properties or classes much in the same way as other unrelated fields of science. Mapping of soil, however, has unique aspects which require adaptations of the ML algorithms. These features are for example, but not limited to, the inclusion of pedological knowledge into the ML algorithm, the accounting of spatial structure present in the soil data, or the desire to increase our scientific understanding of the distribution and genesis of soil from a calibrated ML model. Tackling these challenges is critical for machine learning to gain credibility and scientific consistency in soil science. In this article, we review the current applications of machine learning in digital soil mapping and suggest improvements. We found a growing interest of the use of ML in DSM. Most studies focus on obtaining accurate maps and disregard the characteristics of soil data, such as spatial autocorrelation. Only a few studies account for existing soil knowledge or quantify the uncertainty of the predicted maps. We then discuss the challenges related to the application of ML for soil mapping and offer solutions from existing studies in the natural sciences. The challenges are organized as follows: sampling, resampling, accounting for the spatial information, multivariate mapping, uncertainty analysis, validation, integration of pedological knowledge and, interpretation of the models. We conclude that for future developments, machine learning should incorporate three core elements: plausibility, interpretability, and explainability, which will trigger soil scientists to move beyond model prediction and towards explanation of soil processes.},

This approach has been criticised because the information taken into account was not explicitly specified and validation procedures were not developed. We advocate that pedological knowledge of soil landscape distribution, soil-forming factors and soil processes is essential to modern soil spatial analysis and may be rigorously integrated into soil mapping. Basic reasons for such integration are an increase in prediction efficiency and also the necessity to link soil maps to dynamic modelling, enabling risk assessment and impact studies. Several approaches are reviewed including spatial prediction techniques using existing soil maps and spatial modelling based on soil-forming factors. Combination in the near future of space and time modelling demands additional integration of the dynamics of physical and biochemical soil processes.},

  abstract = {Land type is the base of land change analysis or landscape analysis. Land type classification is often based on land resources survey. Updating land type is generally difficult, mainly due to the lack of appropriate information. Hence, it is of importance to develop a method for land type classification using remote sensing images. The study was to propose the geographic image cognition (GEOIC) approach for land type classification. The approach was realized by the segmentation of land units, using Hyperion image, geographic information, vegetation, soil, DEM, and geosciences knowledge. It is the extension of the methodologies of object-based image analysis. Results showed that the GEOIC approach is an integrated approach with objectification cognition on remote sensing images and multi-source information using geo-knowledge. The GEOIC approach included three aspects: spatial feature perception, spatial object cognition and spatial pattern cognition. The use of the GEOIC approach in land type classification was tested in a study area in the agriculture-pasture mixed region of Loess Plateau in China. Results of land type classification at different scale levels showed that the overall accuracy ranged from 72.4\% to 88.3\%, with an average about 80\%. The accuracy of classification at similar pixel level was relatively low, with an overall accuracy of 73.1\% and Kappa coefficients of 0.69. The classification at scale level of 100 was effective for mapping land types with an overall accuracy of 88.3\% and Kappa coefficients of 0.86. The classification accuracy through the segmentation of land units at an appropriate scale level was higher than that for pixel to pixel methods. This study concluded that the GEOIC approach on land type classification is significant and appears potential for land type classification aiming to land assessment and planning.},

  abstract = {Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural soils influence soil quality and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Dry farmland covers more than 70\% of the whole cropland area in China and plays an important role in mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In this study, 4 109 dry farmland soil polygons were extracted using spatial overlay analysis of the soil layer (1:500 000) and the land use layer (1:500 000) to support Century model simulations of SOC dynamics for dry farmland in Anhui Province, East China from 1980 to 2008. Considering two field-validation sites, the Century model performed relatively well in modeling SOC dynamics for dry farmland in the province. The simulated results showed that the area-weighted mean soil organic carbon density (SOCD) of dry farmland increased from 18.77 Mg C ha−1 in 1980 to 23.99 Mg C ha−1 in 2008 with an average sequestration rate of 0.18 Mg C ha−1 year−1. Approximately 94.9\% of the total dry farmland area sequestered carbon while 5.1\% had carbon lost. Over the past 29 years, the net SOC gain in dry farmland soils of the province was 19.37 Tg, with an average sequestration rate of 0.67 Tg C year−1. Augmentation of SOC was primarily due to increased consumption of nitrogen fertilizer and farmyard manure. Moreover, SOC dynamics were highly differentiated among dry farmland soil groups. The integration of the Century model with a fine-scale soil database approach could be conveniently utilized as a tool for the accurate simulation of SOC dynamics at the regional scale.},

  abstract = {Soil salinization is one of the most predominant processes responsible for land degradation globally. However, monitoring large areas presents significant challenges due to strong spatial and temporal variability. Environmental covariates show promise in predicting salinity over large areas provided a reasonable relationship is developed with field measured salinity at few points. While simple regression-based approaches to complex data mining methods have been used in the prediction, a comprehensive comparison of their performances has not been explored, leading to uncertainty in which algorithms to select. This study compares thirteen popularly and non-popularly used algorithms and their performances following four criteria in predicting soil salinity from environmental covariates from Kuqa Oasis from Xinjiang, China. The environmental covariates used for the prediction include principal components of Landsat satellite images at multiple spectral bands, climate factors (referring to land surface temperature), vegetation indices, salinity and soil-related indices, soil moisture indices, DEM derived indices, land use, landform and soil type and categorized them under parameter categories of the SCORPAN (S, soils; C, climate; O, organisms, biotic factor; R, relief; P, parent material; A, age; and N, space) model. The predictive relationships were developed using the algorithms including some previously used ones such as Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), M5 Model Tree (M5), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and some that have not previously been used in predicting salinity such as Alternating Model Tree (ATM), Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), Least Median Squared Linear Regression (LMSLR), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). Here, 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset (30\% overall samples) at three depths, 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm, were used for parameter optimization and evaluating the performance of algorithms. The performances of these algorithms were compared against multiple criteria, including the parameterization, error level/fitting accuracy (determination coefficient, R2; root mean squared error, RMSE), stability (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, R; mean absolute percent error, MAPE; root mean squared error, RMSE; Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, LCCC) and computational efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the result showed that CSRI is most important parameter for the prediction of soil salinity at the 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm depths, whereas for the 30–50 cm depth interval, VD was the most important predictor. For depths of 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm and 30–50 cm across all models, the model R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.74, 0.15 to 0.31, and 0.30 to 0.47, and the RMSE values ranged from 18.87 to 23.49 dS m−1, 9.94 to 13.48 dS m−1 and 3.79 to 7.11 dS m−1. The optimal algorithms at three depths of 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm and 30–50 cm are RF, M5 and GRBF with considering accuracy and stability. After a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance, we recommend RF for mapping salinity in an arid environment such as that of Xinjiang and elsewhere globally. However, there is no algorithm that can perform ideally for all datasets. Therefore, we suggest that the algorithm should be carefully chosen according to the purposes of the study.},

Of course, soils in the field do not change at these political boundaries. These soilto-soil mismatches are the result of the past structuring of the soil survey program. For many years, soil surveys in the US were conducted on a soil survey area basis. Most times the soil surveys areas were based on county boundaries. Often adjacent counties were mapped years apart. Different personnel, different philosophies of soil survey science, new concepts of mapping and the availability of various technologies all play a part in why these differences occur. These differences maybe even more exaggerated at state lines as each state was administratively and technically responsible for the soil survey program within a given state.},

  abstract = {Precise and spatially explicit regional estimates of soil salinity are necessary to efficiently management and utilise limited land and water resources. Despite advances achieved in remote sensing over the past century, knowledge about the distribution and severity of soil salinization in economically important areas, such as oasis agroecosystems and desert-oasis ecotones (OADoE), is currently limited. An example of an area is southern Xinjiang, where the OADoE has a high anthropogenic influence. This study was conducted with the aim of mapping soil salinity in typical OADoE using remote sensing and machine learning techniques (Cubist and Random Forest, RF). A range of covariates was obtained from the multi-temporal Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) satellite for the period from 2013 –2018. The values of coefficients of determination (R2), Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and relative root mean squared error values, were 0.78, 0.87, 9.59, and 0.76, respectively, for the Cubist and 0.78, 0.86, 9.79, and 0.78, respectively, for RF models. The slope of the linear fitting equation was higher for the Cubist model (0.75) than for RF (0.69). The explanatory power of Cubist and RF for soil salinity variation were 33.22\% and 31.41\% in the agroecosystem, and 72.25\% and 71.66\% in desert-oasis ecotone, respectively. For the agroecosystem, the range of the predicted values for 89.13\% (Cubist) and 84.78\% (RF) of sample was controlled within the same observational range at an interval of 0–5 dS m-1. Compared to single-year data (from 2013 to 2018), the ability to model spatial variability in soil salinity based on multi-year Landsat OLI images has increased by 16\%–35\%. According to the variable importance evaluation, soil-related indices are the most important predictor variables, followed by vegetation, topography, landform, and land use, with relative importance values of 60\%, 21\%, 16\%, and 3\%, respectively. The predicted map was also broadly consistent with those obtained for Xinjiang in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) from the second national soil survey of China conducted from 1984-1997. The results also showed that the average value of the study area is 8.10 dS m-1 based on the Cubist-based map whereas that of the HWSD is 10.60 dS m-1, this implied that the overall salinity level has reduced by 23.58\%. The methodological framework presented covers all prediction process steps and has considerable potential to be used in future soil salinity mapping at large scales for other similar region as OADoEs. The map derived from the Cubist/RF model revealed more detailed variation information about spatial distribution of the soil salinity compared to HWSD, and can further assist with decision-making when planning and utilising on existing soil and water resources in OADoEs.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key indicator of ecosystem health, with a great potential to affect climate change. This study aimed to develop, evaluate, and compare the performance of support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF) models in predicting and mapping SOC stocks in the Eastern Mau Forest Reserve, Kenya. Auxiliary data, including soil sampling, climatic, topographic, and remotely-sensed data were used for model calibration. The calibrated models were applied to create prediction maps of SOC stocks that were validated using independent testing data. The results showed that the models overestimated SOC stocks. Random forest model with a mean error (ME) of −6.5 Mg C ha−1 had the highest tendency for overestimation, while SVR model with an ME of −4.4 Mg C ha−1 had the lowest tendency. Support vector regression model also had the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) and the highest R2 values (14.9 Mg C ha−1 and 0.6, respectively); hence, it was the best method to predict SOC stocks. Artificial neural network predictions followed closely with RMSE, ME, and R2 values of 15.5, −4.7, and 0.6, respectively. The three prediction maps broadly depicted similar spatial patterns of SOC stocks, with an increasing gradient of SOC stocks from east to west. The highest stocks were on the forest-dominated western and north-western parts, while the lowest stocks were on the cropland-dominated eastern part. The most important variable for explaining the observed spatial patterns of SOC stocks was total nitrogen concentration. Based on the close performance of SVR and ANN models, we proposed that both models should be calibrated, and then the best result applied for spatial prediction of target soil properties in other contexts.},

"This is a lot of extra work for little additional gain. A useful compro‐ mise is the built-in stopifnot(); it checks that each argument is TRUE, and produces a generic error message if not:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/572EJGK5?page=310}{Wickham et al 2016:310})

"Each predicate also comes with a "scalar" version, like is\_scalar\_atomic(), which checks that the length is 1.

  abstract = {A methodological framework to formalise the landscape knowledge of the soil surveyor is presented. It requires structuring of terrain objects in a nested hierarchy, followed by inference and formalisation of knowledge rules. We demonstrate how these rules can be applied in a GIS environment for learning and communicating knowledge. Object subdivision is based on the technique of hierarchical subdivision derived from surveyor experience. Formalisation of contextual knowledge requires Ž1. description of the semantics of object levels in relation to scale, Ž2. definition of objects and attributes and their relation to higher and lower level objects, and Ž3. the knowledge inferred from the objects and its inclusion in the database. The A´ lora case study ŽSouth Spain. illustrates the value of the different object levels of the hierarchy for obtaining information on both soils and land evaluation. Often more than one context Žobject hierarchy. has to be considered to predict this information. We argue that a GIS database requires proper description of the different kinds of formal relationships that exist between objects and object classes, and between elementary and composite objects. We also show that the different scale levels of the multiple hierarchy play an essential role in conveying knowledge for an interdisciplinary application Žland evaluation, land use, erosion, and hydrology.. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Weathering intensity largely controls the degree to which primary minerals are altered to secondary components including clay minerals and oxides. As weathering intensity increases there are changes in the hydrological, geochemical and geophysical characteristics of the regolith. Thus, once calibrated, weathering intensity can be used to predict a range of regolith properties. A weathering intensity index (WII) over the Australian continent has been developed at a 100 m resolution using regression models based on airborne gamma-ray spectrometry imagery and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry measures the concentration of three radioelements — potassium (K), thorium (Th) and uranium (U) at the Earth's surface. The total gamma-ray flux (dose) is also calculated based on the weighted additions of the three radioelements. Regolith accounts for over 85\% of the Australian land area and has a major influence in determining the composition of surface materials and in controlling hydrological and geomorphological processes. The weathering intensity prediction is based on the integration of two regression models. The first uses relief over landscapes with low gamma-ray emissions and the second incorporates radioelement distributions and relief. The application of a stepwise forward multiple regression for the second model generated a weathering intensity index equation of: WII = 6.751 + − 0.851 ∗ K + − 1.319 ∗ Relief + 2.682 ∗ Th/K + − 2.590 ∗ Dose. The WII has been developed for erosional landscapes but also has the potential to inform on deposition processes and materials. The WII correlates well with site based geochemical indices and existing regolith mapping. Interpretation of the WII from regional to local scales and its application in providing more reliable and spatially explicit information on regolith properties are described.},

As fresh bedrock exposures form a small proportion of the landscape, regolith is common in Australia and varies in depth from less than a metre in upland settings to many hundreds of metres (e.g. the Cenozoic Basins). Because of crucial fluxes in gases, water, nutrients, and dissolved salts and variation in permeability and connectivity, knowledge of the nature and depth of regolith is important to many land-based industries, including agriculture and forestry. The minerals industry sees regolith as a barrier to discovery of mineralised rock at depth or as a host of minerals in economic concentrations. There are clearly a range of important characteristics of regolith; depth (and therefore the quantity of regolith) is fundamental for resource inventory and biophysical modelling applications.},

  abstract = {Locally applicable information about climate and soil properties can help farmers identify opportunities and reduce risks associated with changing to new land uses. This article describes techniques for preparing high-resolution regional maps and GIS surfaces of agriculturally relevant climate parameters. Ways of combining these climate surfaces with soil data and information about the physical requirements of crops to identify areas likely to be the most suitable for new high-value crops are then outlined. Innovative features include methods for merging observations from temporary climate stations installed for one to two years in conjunction with longer-term climate station observations to improve input data for the maps, and techniques for mapping quantiles of climatic factors that may constrain agricultural operations. Examples are the expected ‘one-in-five year’ first and last frost dates, and the ‘one-in-five year’ lowest and highest seasonal rainfalls. The use of night-time satellite infrared observations to improve spatial resolution of frost hazard maps is also described. Typical standard errors of these climate mapping techniques are summarised. The benefits of ongoing consultation with local farmers and local government staff during the design and implementation of climate/soil/crop potential studies are described. These include optimising products to meet local needs, quality control of the resulting maps and GIS surfaces through local knowledge, and improved uptake of information by users. Further applications of techniques described in this paper include products useful to the energy sector, preparation of daily gridded climate data estimates for use in water quality and plant growth modelling, and development of regional climate change scenarios.},

  abstract = {In fuzzy clustering, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is the best known and used method. Since the FCM memberships do not always explain the degrees of belonging for the data well, Krishnapuram and Keller proposed a possibilistic approach to clustering to correct this weakness of FCM. However, the performance of Krishnapuram and Keller’s approach depends heavily on the parameters. In this paper, we propose another possibilistic clustering algorithm (PCA) which is based on the FCM objective function, the partition coefficient (PC) and partition entropy (PE) validity indexes. The resulting membership becomes the exponential function, so that it is robust to noise and outliers. The parameters in PCA can be easily handled. Also, the PCA objective function can be considered as a potential function, or a mountain function, so that the prototypes of PCA can be correspondent to the peaks of the estimated function. To validate the clustering results obtained through a PCA, we generalized the validity indexes of FCM. This generalization makes each validity index workable in both fuzzy and possibilistic clustering models. By combining these generalized validity indexes, an unsupervised possibilistic clustering is proposed. Some numerical examples and real data implementation on the basis of the proposed PCA and generalized validity indexes show their effectiveness and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Sampling design plays an important role in soil survey and soil mapping. Conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) has been proven as an efficient sampling strategy and used widely in digital soil mapping. cLHS samples are randomly selected in each stratum of environmental variables, thus the produced sample sets can vary significantly at different runs with the same sample size. Although variation of mapping accuracies caused by the randomness of cLHS has been realized and qualitatively mentioned in past studies. However, how the randomness of cLHS could quantitatively influence mapping accuracy has rarely been examined. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine how the sample randomness quantitatively influence soil mapping accuracy with different sample sizes, and analyzed the possible reasons from a pedogenesis perspective. The results showed that the largest range of mapping accuracies of 500 repeats was 39.5\% at a sample density of 2.59 point/ km2, while the smallest range was 7.3\% at the maximum sample size with a sample density of 32.47 point/km2. The sample density for satisfactory prediction accuracies in our study area was at least 10.06 Point/km2. The results showed that both the allocation of sample points to each soil series and the typicality of sample points played important roles in mapping accuracies. But the deep reasons causing the unstable performance of cLHS at small sample sizes were the imbalanced class distribution of soil series and the overlap between soil series in the distribution of environmental covariates. Researchers need to be cautious about the output when applying cLHS with small sampling densities. Some effective approaches to address this issue include increasing the sample size, checking the sample allocations of a cLHS design with the assistance of legacy soil maps, or adding the legacy soil map as a variable during sampling design. When the sampling resources and legacy soil maps are limited for an area, fuzzy k-means clustering sampling could be a potential alternative. This study provides useful references for better understanding the uncertainty of cLHS when the sample density is small and selecting alternative sampling methods accordingly.},

Openness is an angular measure of the relation between surface relief and horizontal distance. For angles less than 90", it is equivalent to the internal angle of a cone, its apex a t a DEM location, constrained by neighboring elevations within a specified radial distance. Openness incorporates the terrain line-of-sight, or viewshed, concept and is calculated from multiple zenith and nadir angles-here along eight azimuths. Openness has two viewer perspectives. Positive values, expressing openness above the surface, are high for convex forms, whereas negative values describe this attribute below the surface and are high for concave forms. Openness values are mapped by gray-scale tones. The emphasis of terrain convexity and concavity in openness maps facilitates the interpretation of landforms on the Earth's surface and its seafloor, and on the planets, as well as features on any irregular surface-such as those generated by industrial procedures.},

These issues can, at best, make determining the correct preprocessing workflow a difficult and time-­consuming task and, at worst, lead to erroneous r­esults.

We then synthesize this information by presenting workflows and a decision tree for determining the appropriate level of imagery preprocessing given an ecological research question, while emphasizing the need to tailor each workflow to the study site and question at hand. We recommend a parsimonious approach to Landsat preprocessing that avoids unnecessary steps and recommend approaches and data products that are well tested, easily available, and sufficiently documented. Our focus is specific to ecological applications of Landsat data, yet many of the concepts and recommendations discussed are also appropriate for other disciplines and remote sensing platforms.},

"Terrain correction ensures each pixel is displayed as viewed from directly above regardless of topography or view angle, and, while important, does not account for the same effects as topographic correction." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDRZLWKM?page=7}{Young et al 2017:926})

"Given the number of available approaches and the difficulty of their application by nonremote sensing experts, analysts should carefully consider whether a topographic correction is necessary for their study. While this preprocessing step can be more important than atmospheric correction for some applications in topographically complex regions (Vanonckelen et al. 2013), this step is not needed for every scenario."

"A common preprocessing step when using multiple images is a relative radiometric correction or normalization (hereafter referred to as relative correction). Relative correction brings each band of an image to the same radiometric scale as the corresponding band of a reference image." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDRZLWKM?page=8}{Young et al 2017:927})

"Relative correction typically uses the overlapping regions between a reference image and another image to be" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDRZLWKM?page=8}{Young et al 2017:927})
\par
"Two general approaches are used to compare these overlapping regions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDRZLWKM?page=8}{Young et al 2017:927})
\par
"The first is histogram matching (also referred to as equalizing), which uses information from all pixels in the overlapping regions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDRZLWKM?page=8}{Young et al 2017:927})
\par
"We do not recommend histogram matching Landsat data, as this approach is generally used for relatively correcting multiple images from the same day when there is little variation in the solar and atmospheric conditions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDRZLWKM?page=8}{Young et al 2017:927})
\par
"Adjoining Landsat images collected on the same day (i.e., along the same path) can be mosaicked without a relative correction." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDRZLWKM?page=8}{Young et al 2017:927})
\par
"The second approach uses pseudo invariant features (PIF; generally consisting of one or more pixels) or pseudo invariant targets (PIT; generally a single pixel), where nonchanging features or targets in the overlapping area are used to bring the images to a common scale (Schott et al. 1988)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDRZLWKM?page=8}{Young et al 2017:927})
\par
"Comparisons have shown that performing a relative correction might provide more accurate results than an absolute atmospheric correction, especially when comparability is more important than the pixel value (Schroeder et al. 2006)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GDRZLWKM?page=8}{Young et al 2017:927})
\par
"If the objective is to obtain images that are spatially or temporally consistent (and that is the only goal of the relative correction), then relative correction from a more basic preprocessing level, such as DN or TOA, would be the most appropriate option, as correcting to surface reflectance serves no purpose and injects a potential source of error."

  abstract = {The efficiency of different digital and conventional soil mapping approaches to produce categorical maps of soil types is determined by cost, sample size, accuracy and the selected taxonomic level. The efficiency of digital and conventional soil mapping approaches was examined in the semi-arid region of Borujen, central Iran. This research aimed to (i) compare two digital soil mapping approaches including Multinomial logistic regression and random forest, with the conventional soil mapping approach at four soil taxonomic levels (order, suborder, great group and subgroup levels), (ii) validate the predicted soil maps by the same validation data set to determine the best method for producing the soil maps, and (iii) select the best soil taxonomic level by different approaches at three sample sizes (100, 80, and 60 point observations), in two scenarios with and without a geomorphology map as a spatial covariate. In most predicted maps, using both digital soil mapping approaches, the best results were obtained using the combination of terrain attributes and the geomorphology map, although differences between the scenarios with and without the geomorphology map were not significant. Employing the geomorphology map increased map purity and the Kappa index, and led to a decrease in the ‘noisiness’ of soil maps. Multinomial logistic regression had better performance at higher taxonomic levels (order and suborder levels); however, random forest showed better performance at lower taxonomic levels (great group and subgroup levels). Multinomial logistic regression was less sensitive than random forest to a decrease in the number of training observations. The conventional soil mapping method produced a map with larger minimum polygon size because of traditional cartographic criteria used to make the geological map 1:100,000 (on which the conventional soil mapping map was largely based). Likewise, conventional soil mapping map had also a larger average polygon size that resulted in a lower level of detail. Multinomial logistic regression at the order level (map purity of 0.80), random forest at the suborder (map purity of 0.72) and great group level (map purity of 0.60), and conventional soil mapping at the subgroup level (map purity of 0.48) produced the most accurate maps in the study area. The multinomial logistic regression method was identified as the most effective approach based on a combined index of map purity, map information content, and map production cost. The combined index also showed that smaller sample size led to a preference for the order level, while a larger sample size led to a preference for the great group level.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about distribution of soil properties over the landscape is required for a variety of land management applications and resources, modeling, and monitoring practices. The main aim of this research was to conduct a spatially prediction of the top soil properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), and clay content using digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches in Borujen region, Chaharmahal-VaBakhtiari province, central Iran. To achieve this goal, a total of 334 soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth. Three non-linear models including Cubist (Cu), Random Forest (RF), Regression Tree (RT) and a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used to link environmental covariates and the studied soil properties. The environmental covariates were obtained from a digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite imagery (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper; ETM). The model was calibrated and validated by the 10-fold cross-validation approach. Root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to determine the performance of the models, and relative RMSE (RMSE\%) was used to define prediction accuracy. According to the RMSE and R2, Cu and RF resulted in the most accurate predictions for CCE (R2 = 0.30 and RMSE = 9.52) and clay contents (R2 = 0.15 and RMSE = 7.86), respectively, while both of RF and Cu models showed the highest performance to predict SOC content (R2 = 0.55). Results showed that remote sensing covariates (Ratio Vegetation Index and band 4) were the most important variables to explain the variability of SOC and CCE content, but only topographic attributes were responsible for clay content variation. According to RMSE\% results, it could be concluded that the best model is not necessarily able to make the most accurate estimation. This study recommended that more observations and denser sampling should be carried out in the entire study area. Alternatively, stratified sampling by elevation in homogeneous sub-areas was recommended. The stratified sampling probably will increase the performance of models.},

The objective of this study was to disaggregate a legacy 1:1,000,000 soil map by three methods of disaggregation: a supervised classification method (DSMART algorithm) and two unsupervised classification methods including fuzzy c-means (FCM) and k-means (KM) clustering in Borujen region, Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari Province, Central Iran for both great group and subgroup Taxonomic levels. Although field validation indicated that the accuracy of the disaggregated soil maps was lower than that of the conventional soil map at both levels of Soil Taxonomy, disaggregated approaches produced more detailed soil maps when compared with the first, second, and third most probable soil classes of the conventional soil map. The higher overall accuracy of the conventional soil map was due to soil association units which consist of more than one soil taxonomic class. FCM and DSMART methods produced more accurate and detailed disaggregated soil maps than KM clustering algorithm at the great group and subgroup levels, respectively. We concluded that the decision on what method to use depends on the map, the level of available information (map detail), available expert knowledge, and the availability of the soil unit composition percentages in the soil map legend.},

"DSMART allows the user to set project-specific parameters. The random sample sizem was set to 15. The model type that Odgers et al.

The type of data mining algorithm implemented in DSMART is not prescribed; as long as it is robust and, importantly, computationally efficient. For example, Chaney et al. (2014) used Random Forest models in their implementation of DSMART. In our study, the C4.5 decision tree algorithm was applied.

  abstract = {Demand for accurate soil information is increasing for various applications. This paper investigates the history of soil survey in Iran, particularly more recent developments in the use of digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches rather than conventional soil mapping (CSM) methods. A 2000–2019 literature search of articles on DSM of areas of Iran in international journals found 40 studies. These showed an increase in frequency over time, and most were completed in the arid and semi-arid regions of central Iran. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forests (RF), and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MnLR) were the most commonly applied models for predicting soil classes and properties and ANN performed best in most comparative studies. Given the scale of inquiry of most studies (local or regional), quantitative environmental variables such as terrain attributes and remote sensing data were frequently used whereas qualitative variables such as geomorphology, geology, land use, and legacy soil maps were rarely used. The literature review of CSM showed that this method is incapable of defining the spatial distribution of soils and also provides a lower accuracy than DSM method. This review has identified research gaps that need filling. In Iran, coherent national scale DSM with consistent methodology is needed to update legacy soil maps, and to apply DSM in forestlands, hillslopes, deserts, and mountainous regions which have largely been ignored in recent DSM studies. This review should also be useful for producing more local and regional digital soil maps more rapidly as it helps show which covariates and mathematical methods have been best suited to this scale of DSM in Iran.},

  abstract = {To deal with the global and regional issues including food security, climate change, land degradation, biodiversity loss, water resource management, and ecosystem health, detailed accurate spatial soil information is urgently needed. This drives the worldwide development of digital soil mapping. In recent years, significant progresses have been made in different aspects of digital soil mapping. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a review for the major progresses of digital soil mapping in the last decade. First, we briefly described the rise of digital soil mapping and outlined important milestones and their influence, and main paradigms in digital soil mapping. Then, we reviewed the progresses in legacy soil data, environmental covariates, soil sampling, predictive models and the applications of digital soil mapping products. Finally, we summarized the main trends and future prospect as revealed by studies up to now. We concluded that although the digital soil mapping is now moving towards mature to meet various demands of soil information, challenges including new theories, methodologies and applications of digital soil mapping, especially for highly heterogeneous and human-affected environments, still exist and need to be addressed in the future.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional digital soil mapping (3D-DSM) quantifies both the horizontal and the vertical variability of soil properties. Most current studies in 3D-DSM were based on either one-dimensional profile depth functions or two-dimensional horizontal interpolation techniques, which did not allow true 3D visualization of spatial soil heterogeneity. Only a few studies have utilized the 3D variograms for mapping. Recent advances in proximal soil sensing technologies allow measurement and prediction of soil properties rapidly at multiple depths which could serve as input data for DSM. Various soil physical and chemical properties have already shown either direct or indirect relationships with the proximal soil sensing data. This study aims to test the methodology of 3D-DSM by incorporating a 3D regression kriging (RK) with multiple proximal soil sensing techniques. In this study, vis-NIR spectra were collected in-situ at 148 locations to about 1-m depth using the Veris® P4000 soil profiler at Field 26 of Macdonald Farm, McGill University. Additionally, 32 soil cores were collected out of the 148 locations to 1-m maximum depth and sectioned at 10-cm depth intervals for laboratory analysis of volumetric water content (VWC), soil organic matter (SOM), and clay content. Cubist spectral models were developed for each soil property at the 32 locations and then predicted to the 148 locations, which were then randomly split into calibration (70\%, 103 locations) and validation (30\%, 45 locations) datasets for mapping. The 3D-RK method included a trend prediction between calibration dataset and environmental covariates (including apparent soil electrical conductivity, gamma-ray radiation, and elevation) and a residual kriging. The generalized linear model (GLM), regression tree (RT), and random forest (RF) models were compared for trend prediction. The covariates were also simulated 100 times using sequential Gaussian simulations to fit into 3D-RK and calculate model uncertainty. As a result, complete 3D digital soil maps with uncertainty were developed. We found that the RF model outperformed GLM and RT in regard to interpreting non-linear soil-landscape relationships and resulting in marginally higher validation accuracy and smaller prediction uncertainty for VWC and clay. The GLM model resulted in slightly better validation results and smaller model uncertainty for SOM only. SOM and clay showed large horizontal and vertical variability and affected the spatial distribution of VWC. The validation accuracy was higher in the soil surface for most soil properties due to the uniform environment in the plow layer and sufficient environmental covariates collected at the soil surface. The mapping uncertainty increased with depth for VWC and clay content but decreased with depth for SOM because SOM content decreases with depth.},

  abstract = {A geographical information system (GIS) or expert knowledgebased fuzzy soil inference scheme (soil-land inference model, SoLIM) is described. The scheme consists of three major components: (i) a model employing a similarity representation of soils, (ii) a set of inference techniques for deriving the similarity representation, and (iii) use of the similarity representation. The similarity representation allows the soil landscape to be considered as a continuum, and thereby overcomes the generalization of soils in conventional soil mapping. The set of inference techniques is based on the soil factor equation and the soil–landscape model. The soil–landscape concept contends that if one knows the relationships between each soil and its environment for an area, then one is able to infer what soil might be at each location on the landscape by assessing the environmental conditions at that point. Under the SoLIM, soil environmental conditions over an area are characterized using GIS or remote sensing techniques. The relationships between soils and their formative environmental conditions are extracted from local soil experts or from field observations using a set of artificial intelligence techniques. The characterized environmental conditions are then combined with the extracted relationships to derive a similarity representation of soils over an area. It is demonstrated through two case studies that the SoLIM for soil survey has many advantages over the conventional soil survey approach. Soil information products derived through the SoLIM are of high quality in terms of both level of spatial detail and degree of attribute accuracy. In addition, the scheme shows promise for improving the efficiency of soil survey and subsequent updates through reducing time and costs of conducting a survey. However, the degree of success of the SoLIM highly depends on the availability and quality of environmental data, and the quality of knowledge on soil–environmental relationships over the study area.},

  abstract = {Fuzzy characterization of slope positions is important for geographic modeling. Most of the existing fuzzy classification-based methods for fuzzy characterization require extensive user intervention in data preparation and parameter setting, which is tedious and time-consuming. This paper presents an automatic approach to overcoming these limitations in the prototype-based inference method for deriving fuzzy membership value (or similarity) to slope positions. The key contribution is a procedure for finding the typical locations and setting the fuzzy inference parameters for each slope position type. Instead of being determined totally by users in the prototype-based inference method, in the proposed approach the typical locations and fuzzy inference parameters for each slope position type are automatically determined by a rule set based on prior domain knowledge and the frequency distributions of topographic attributes. Furthermore, the preparation of topographic attributes (e.g., slope gradient, curvature, and relative position index) is automated, so the proposed automatic approach has only one necessary input, i.e., the gridded digital elevation model of the study area. All compute-intensive algorithms in the proposed approach were speeded up by parallel computing. Two study cases were provided to demonstrate that this approach can properly, conveniently and quickly derive the fuzzy slope positions.},
